  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the assertion/presupposition distinction maps fairly directly onto the distinction between new and old information. This assumption is made doubtful by presupposing constructions that regularly convey new information: uniquely identifying descriptions, ‘informative presupposition’ it-clefts, reverse wh-clefts, announcements embedded under factives, nonrestrictive relatives. The presupposed content conveyed by these constructions can be regarded as part of the common ground only with an unconstrained principle of accommodation. But this reduces the claim that grammatical presuppositions are part of the common ground to vacuity. Presuppositions are a consequence of two factors. One is a tendency to limit assertion to one atomic proposition per rooted sentence. The other is the fact that almost any thought to be expressed will involve many atomic propositions. Depending on medium, genre and other contextual variables, new information will be presupposed if it is not necessary to assert it. The view is confirmed by evidence that written language, which would be expected to contain more new information per utterance than spoken language, contains a higher proportion of text in definite descriptions.},

  abstract = {A central question in the study of presuppositions is how a presupposition trigger contributes to the meaning of a complex expression containing it. Two competing answers are found in the literature on quantificational expressions. According to the first, a quantificational expression presupposes that every member of its domain satisfies the presuppositions triggered in its scope, and according to the second, a quantificational expression presupposes that at least one member of its domain satisfies the presuppositions triggered in its scope. The former view implies that an interrogative clause, a kind of quantificational expression, presupposes all of its possible answers’ presuppositions, whereas the latter view implies that an interrogative clause presupposes that the presuppositions of at least one of is possible answers are satisfied. This paper contributes to the debate by showing that ‘alternative’ interrogatives, formed with or, project presuppositions in the same, distinctive manner that other disjunctive constructions do: generally, universally. A theory that treats disjunctive words as restricted variables, bindable by various quantificational operators, is extended to account for the presuppositions of ‘alternative’ interrogatives, disjoined declaratives, and disjoined conditional antecedents in a uniform manner. The paper then explores some ways to reconcile the proposal with two special cases where interrogatives have been claimed to have weaker presuppositions: (1) constituent interrogatives in presupposition-weakening contexts, and (2) polar interrogatives containing bias-inducing scalar particles like even.},

An inquisitive semantics also models the case when disjunctive permission is continued with “but I do not know which” which coerces an ignorance reading. We also demonstrate that a principled approach to negation provides a monotonic but restricted definition of entailment, which solves the problem of strengthening with a conjunct that is used as a counterargument against violation-based accounts.},

  abstract = {Several researchers have suggested that languages vary as to whether number marking on noun phrases is obligatory or optional. We develop an implementation of this idea within a theory that assumes that the plural is a semantically vacuous, unmarked number (Sauerland et al. 2015 and others). We then explore the semantic consequences of this proposal. One striking prediction of the proposal is that plural nouns should be ungrammatical in antitone environments in languages where number marking is optional, i.e. plurals should be positive polarity items in optional number languages. This prediction arises because the plural form is equivalent to the number neutral bare form in optional number languages. The Efficiency requirement of Meyer 2013 therefore predicts that plurals require local exhaustification in optional number languages since otherwise the bare form is more efficient. Because bare forms are impossible in obligatory number languages, plurals are not predicted to be positive polarity items in such languages. We conclude with an outlook on how to empirically verify the predictions of the theory we presented.},

Grice influentially argued that the assumption that such divergence does in fact exist is a mistake originating “from inadequate attention to the nature and importance of the conditions governing conversation” (Grice 1989: 24). I will first show that when applied to free choice phenomena, the standard implementation of Grice’s view, representing semantics and pragmatics as two separate components, is empirically inadequate. I will then propose a different account: a bilateral state-based modal logic modelling next to literal meanings also pragmatic factors and the additional inferences that arise from their interaction. The pragmatic factor I will consider connects to a tendency of language users to neglect empty configurations when engaging in linguistic interpretation. The non-emptiness atom (ne) from team semantics provides a perspicuous way to formally represent this tendency and to rigorously study its impact on interpretation. In terms of ne, I will define a pragmatic enrichment function and show that, in interaction with disjunction occurring in positive contexts and only in these cases, pragmatic enrichment yields non-trivial effects including predicting free choice inferences and their cancellation under negation. The latter result relies on the adopted bilateralism, where each connective comes with an assertion and a rejection condition and negation is defined in terms of the latter notion. BibTeX info},

  abstract = {The natural interpretation of counterfactuals with disjunctive antecedents involves selecting from each of the disjuncts the worlds that come closest to the world of evaluation. It has been long noticed that capturing this interpretation poses a problem for a minimal change semantics for counterfactuals, because selecting the closest worlds from each disjunct requires accessing the denotation of the disjuncts from the denotation of the disjunctive antecedent, which the standard boolean analysis of or does not allow (Creary and Hill, Philosophy of Science 43:341–344, 1975; Nute, Journal of Philosophy 72:773–778, 1975; Fine, Mind 84(335):451–458, 1975; Ellis et~al. Journal of Philosophical Logic 6:335–357, 1977). This paper argues that the failure to capture the natural interpretation of disjunctive counterfactuals provides no reason to abandon a minimal change semantics. It shows that the natural interpretation of disjunctive counterfactuals is expected once we refine our assumptions about the semantics of or and the logical form of conditionals, and (i) we assume that disjunctions introduce propositional alternatives in the semantic derivation, in line with independently motivated proposals about the semantics of or (Aloni, 2003a; Simons, Natural Language Semantics 13:271–316, 2005; Alonso-Ovalle, Disjunction in Alternative Semantics. PhD thesis, 2006); and (ii) we treat conditionals as correlative constructions, as advocated in von Fintel (1994), Izvorski (Proceedings of NELS 26, 1996), Bhatt and Pancheva (2006), and Schlenker (2004).},

  abstract = {The standard semantic analysis of natural language disjunction maintains that or is the Boolean join. This dissertation makes a case for a Hamblin-style semantics, under which disjunctions denote sets of propositions. Chapter 2 shows that the standard semantics does not capture the natural interpretation of counterfactual conditionals with disjunctive antecedents. Together with a standard minimal change semantics for counterfactuals, the standard semantics predicts that these counterfactuals are evaluated by selecting the closest worlds from the union of the propositions that or operates over. Their natural interpretation, however, requires selecting the closest worlds from each of the propositions that or operates over. This interpretation is predicted under a Hamblin-style semantics if conditionals are analyzed as correlative constructions. Chapter 3 deals with the exclusive component of unembedded disjunctions. The exclusive component of a disjunction S with more than two atomic disjuncts can be derived as an implicature if S competes in the pragmatics with all the conjunctions that can be formed out of its atomic disjuncts. The generation of these pragmatic competitors proves challenging under the standard analysis of or, because the interpretation system does not have access to the atomic disjuncts. Under a Hamblin semantics, however, the required pragmatic competitors can be generated by mapping each non-empty subset [special characters omitted] of the denotation of S to the proposition that is true in a world w if and only if all the members of [special characters omitted] are true in w. Chapter 4 investigates the interpretation of disjunctions under the scope of modals. When uttered by a speaker who knows who may have what, a sentence of the form of Sandy may have ice cream or cake naturally conveys that Sandy has two rights: the right to have ice cream, and the right to have cake. Under the standard analysis of or and modals, however, the sentence is predicted to be true as long as Sandy has at least one of the rights. A Hamblin style analysis allows for the derivation of the requirement that Sandy has two rights as an implicature of domain widening.},

What is the mechanism behind the surprisingly weak inference? The approach in von Fintel \&amp; Iatridou 2007 is to revise the analysis of only itself to weaken its contribution. In this paper, however, we argue that Horn’s only is correct after all, and introduce a source of weakening separate from only. In particular, in von Fintel \&amp; Iatridou’s modal environment, a phonetically null operator (AT LEAST; Crnic̆ 2011, Schwarz 2005) occurs in the scope of only to weaken the presupposed prejacent. Much recent attention has been paid to covert operators which strengthen meaning, in particular a covert EXH with a meaning similar to only (e.g. Chierchia 2006, Fox 2007, Chierchia et al. 2012). A key consequence of our analysis is that natural language incorporates a covert weakening operator, as well. BibTeX info},

We contend that the two types of indefinites impose different constraints on their domain of quantification: irgendein and its kin are domain wideners (Kratzer and Shimoyama 2002), whereas algún is an ‘anti-singleton’ indefinite (its domain cannot be restricted to a singleton). This, together with the fact that algún does not require uniqueness, allows us to derive the contrast between irgendein and algún by using the pragmatic reasoning presented by Kratzer and Shimoyama.},

  abstract = {First and last have been variously described as ordinals, superlatives, or both. These descriptions are generally not accompanied by extensive argumentation, and those who label first and last as superlatives do not present and argue for a particular decomposition. Thus, first and last’s status as ordinals vs. superlatives and their internal composition remain open issues. In this paper, I argue that first and last are superlatives, in particular the superlative forms of before and after. To argue that first and last are superlatives, I show that they pattern like superlatives and unlike ordinals (second, third, etc.) with respect to plurality, modifier choice, “modal superlatives” with possible, and the ordinal superlative construction. I next argue that the relations between before and first and between after and last show themselves overtly in many languages and in English paraphrases; furthermore, first and last semantically differ in ways that before and after have also been noted to differ. While I acknowledge one observation that prima facie counterexemplifies these claims, I argue that it constitutes a genuine counterexample only if one formalizes my decomposition of first/last using a standard Heimian (Heim in Notes on superlatives. Manuscript, MIT (1999)) entry for -est. The counterexample, which concerns the “upstairs de dicto” reading of superlatives, ceases to be an issue if one treats before and after as simplex and formalizes my decomposition using a Containment Hypothesis-inspired semantics (Bobaljik in Universals in comparative morphology: Suppletion, superlatives, and the structure of words, MIT Press, Cambridge, 2012) for -est.},

  abstract = {One of the central topics in semantic theory over the last few decades concerns the nature of local contexts. Recently, theorists have tried to develop general, non-stipulative accounts of local contexts (Ingason, 2016; Mandelkern \&amp; Romoli, 2017a; Schlenker, 2009). In this paper, we contribute to this literature by drawing attention to the local contexts of subclausal expressions. More specifically, we focus on the local contexts of quantificational determiners, e.g. ‘all’, ‘both’, etc. Our central tool for probing the local contexts of subclausal elements is the principle Maximize Presupposition! (Percus, 2006; Singh, 2011). The empirical basis of our investigation concerns some data discussed by Anvari (2018b), e.g. the fact that sentences such as ‘All of the two presidential candidates are crooked’ are unacceptable. In order to explain this, we suggest that the local context of determiners needs to contain the information carried by their restrictor. However, no existing non-stipulative account predicts this. Consequently, we think that the local contexts of subclausal expressions will likely have to be stipulated. This result has important consequences for debates in semantics and pragmatics, e.g. those around the so-called “explanatory problem” for dynamic semantics (Heim, 1990; Schlenker, 2009; Soames, 1982).},

  abstract = {This paper brings a developmental perspective to the discussion of a longstanding issue surrounding the proper characterization of presuppositions. On an influential view (Stalnaker in Synthese 22(1–2):272–289, 1970; Stalnaker, in Milton, Unger (eds) Semantics and philosophy, New York University Press, New York, 1974; Karttunen in Theor Linguist 1:181–194, 1974), formal presuppositions reflect admittance conditions: an utterance of a sentence which presupposes p is admitted by a conversational context c only if p is common ground in c. The theory distinguishes two modes of satisfying this formal requirement: (i) presuppositions may have common ground status prior to utterance, or (ii) they may achieve common ground status post hoc, via accommodation, an adjustment of the common ground by cooperative listeners so as to meet the requirements of an uttered sentence. While intuitive and general, the theory has been criticized (among other things) on methodological grounds (see e.g. Gazdar in Pragmatics: implicature, presupposition and logical form, Academic Press, New York, 1979): the availability of accommodation makes it difficult to empirically examine the notion of presupposition as admittance conditions because a central tenet—pragmatic infelicity results whenever c does not entail p—may be masked due to the pragmatic sophistication of language users. In this paper, we argue that child language presents an opportunity to avoid this intrinsic difficulty. In a series of behavioral experiments, we show that young children generate a default expectation that the presuppositions of an asserted sentence have common ground status prior to utterance. Furthermore and more tellingly, we also find that even when accommodation is the preferred option for adults, children fail to accommodate presuppositions in an adult-like manner. This pattern of behavior, we argue, is expected under the admittance theory: in a population where the interference from accommodation is reduced, the impact of failing to satisfy the formal admittance conditions becomes directly observable.},

We propose that the environments giving rise to these effects involve a discourse move that corrects for over-restrictive assumptions about the domain in the immediately preceding move. Crucially, the second move must be compatible with the first. General considerations about how the discourse unfolds, in conjunction with a principle that sentences are interpreted exhaustively by default, make it so that two sentences in such sequences are mutually inconsistent in the absence of the additive.},

Since Verkuyl (1973), it has been noted that the endpoint of an event may be affected by nominal elements within the VP, e.g. Number on the verbal argument (plural or singular). The chapter proposes that similar aspectual effects of Number are also found in the domain of verbal suffixes (cf. Bar-el, 2008; Ferreira 2005; Yu 2003). The chapter shows that a Lithuanian verbal suffix –inė- , traditionally considered aspectual, encodes Number of events while its aspectual effects are secondary. Building on the similarity of aspectual effects, the chapter proposes a unified account of Number across verbal and nominal domains.},

By varying the scenarios in which an expression such as “Pick the crate with a banana” is evaluated, we show that the strengthening of “crate with a banana” within the scope of the definite article parallels the entailments of “crate with only a banana” (with an overt exhaustivity operator, ‘only’). We use this observation to argue that strengthening in embedded positions follows the logic of an exhaustivity operator rather than that of rational inference. We then note that a similar pattern obtains in matrix positions.},

  abstract = {One of the main goals of theories of plural definites is to account for so-called ‘non-maximal readings,’ i.e. readings in which sentences like Frank opened his presents can be judged true even if Frank didn’t open a few of his presents. Specifically, theories differ with respect to dealing with these cases in positive and negative contexts. The implicature approach, on the one hand, predicts an inherent asymmetry between positive and negative sentences: plural definites are predicted to straightforwardly allow for non-maximal readings in positive sentences but not in negative ones. The non-implicature approach, on the other hand, makes symmetric predictions: all else being equal, non-maximal readings should be available to the same degree in positive and negative sentences. Previous experimental work found evidence for an asymmetry between positive and negative cases, more in line with the implicature approach. However, as previous studies did not control for potential contextual effects, we cannot rule out that context may have affected non-maximality in the two cases in different ways, thus giving rise to the observed asymmetry in a way that is compatible with both approaches. In this paper, we report on two experiments using a picture-sentence verification task, testing the effect of context on the non-maximality of plural definites in positive and negative sentences. More specifically, we tested sentences containing the plural definite ‘his/her presents’ under a positive quantifier ‘every boy/girl’ and two negative quantifiers ‘no boy/girl’ and ‘not every boy/girl,’ manipulating what was relevant in the context. Our results indicate that while non-maximal readings under all three quantifiers is modulated by context, the effect size is much smaller for no than for the other two quantifiers. We argue that these findings pose challenges for both types of theories, and discuss possible amendments of each approach in order to account for our findings. We also sketch how the same experimental design can be extended to test related phenomena, where we find similar debates between implicature and non-implicature accounts.},

This is problematic for many cases in which EXH is used to derive the desired inferences.

The predictions of the two theories with regard to the insertion of the trigger in embedding environments and with regard to the influence of discourse on the obligatory insertion of triggers are compared. The empirical predictions of the theories are tested using experimental methods in the main part of the thesis. The presupposition triggers "again", "too", "know" and the definite determiner are tested with regard to their obligatory insertion under negation and in other complex structures. Furthermore, the influence of the broader discourse context on their obligatory insertion is investigated. The empirical findings are summarized in the last part of the thesis and the theoretical consequences for a theory of grammar are discussed. It is argued based on the empirical results that presupposition triggers fall into two classes regarding the mechanisms behind their obligatory insertion. Whereas the obligatory insertion of lexical triggers like "too", "again" and "know" is better explained by making use of 'Obligatory Implicatures', obligatoriness of definiteness and other feature marking should be accounted for by using 'Maximize Presupposition'.},

  abstract = {Comparatives with more plus mass noun, like John has more milk than Bill, are naturally analyzed as referencing measure functions, functions like volume or weight that map individuals to degrees. Although such measure functions vary with context as well as the choice of mass noun, there are well known grammatical limitations on this variation. In particular, Schwarzschild (2006) proposes that only monotonic measure functions can enter into the interpretation of comparatives with more plus mass noun. While this Monotonicity Constraint has strong empirical support, Bale \&amp; Barner (2009) have drawn attention to data that seemingly contradict it. For example, There is more gold in the ring than in the bracelet can be evaluated based on whether the ring is made from purer gold than the bracelet. This seems to suggest that comparatives with more plus mass noun can reference purity, yet purity is non-monotonic ( Schwarzschild 2006; Wellwood 2015). Building on Solt (2018) and Bale \&amp; Schwarz (2020), we show here that comparisons of purity can be credited to monotonic proportional measure functions, thereby reconciling Bale \&amp; Barner (2009)’s observation with the Monotonicity Constraint. We provide independent support for this proposal, establishing that reference to the relevant monotonic proportional measure functions, but not to purity, yields meanings that accurately track speakers’ truth value judgments. Our analysis commits us to the assumption that the main clause and the comparative clause can invoke different measure functions. We propose that this is made possible by Skolemization and binding. Specifically, we posit covert expressions denoting measure functions which contain variables bound by different expressions in the two clauses.},

Some languages, like English, require count syntax whereas others, like Mandarin, lack count syntax and typically use classifiers. Here, the chapter asks what appears to be a simple question: how do children determine whether their language makes a distinction between mass and count syntax? This question reveals itself to be subtle and difficult when languages beyond English and Mandarin are considered. The chapter argues that prototypical syntactic and morphological differences between mass-count and classifier languages are not constitutive of this typological difference. The use of classifiers, the combination of numerals with bare nouns, and even plural morphology can occur in both mass-count and classifier languages. As a result, such features cannot be sufficient for determining whether or not a language has count syntax. Instead, the chapter argues that it is the relation of these syntactic structures to their semantic interpretations that differentiates languages and guides acquisition. Only mass-count languages can specify exclusive reference to singularities in absence of classifiers or measure words.},

The goal of this paper is to provide an account which is less stipulative and has wider empirical coverage than previous accounts, based on a novel notion of communicative stability. Using a model of a rational speaker we observe that attested languages are stable languages, i.e., languages in which the optimal message for a speaker to choose when they want to convey a particular state they are in is not affected by which states they take to be more likely and which ones less.

We argue for a modification of Denić’s generalization, and provide an explanation that is based on intricate logical computations but is blind to probabilities. The explanation is based on the observation that when the domain size is no larger than the number of disjuncts, universal and existential alternatives are equivalent if distributive inferences are obtained. We argue that under such conditions a general ban on ‘fatal competition’ (Magri 2009a,b, Spector 2014) is activated, thereby predicting distributive inferences to be unavailable.},

  abstract = {A prominent view of homogeneity takes it to be the result of a trivalent distributivity operator. Križ (2015) challenged this view by pointing out the existence of non-distributive plural predication which is nonetheless homogeneous. In this paper I argue that this challenge disappears once a trivalent cumulativity operator (based on Link’s star operator), which derives meanings that are underspecified for distributivity and collectivity, is taken to be responsible for homogeneity instead. I point out that when this view is combined with a solution offered by Schwarzschild and Heim for the challenge of deriving both underspecified and ambiguous meanings (using ‘covers’), the challenge of deriving both distributive and non-distributive homogeneity is immediately resolved. I further argue that the view that emerges provides an explanation for the variation between predicates with respect to homogeneity and underspecification, and correctly predicts it to be context-dependent.

The arguments come from asymmetries between positive and negatives sentences containing definite plurals with respect to (1) children’s behavior (Tieu et al. in Front Psychol, 2019. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02329), (2) the availability of Non-maximal readings, and (3) the robustness of neither-true-nor-false (‘gappy’) judgments (Križ and Chemla in Nat Lang Semant 23(3):205–248, 2015). I propose to avoid some problems of Magri’s analysis by modeling the Implicature account of Homogeneity after the Implicature account of Free Choice, based on a hitherto unnoticed analogy between the two phenomena. The approach that emerges has the advantages of Magri’s implicature account of Homogeneity (predicting asymmetries), while at the same time bears a close resemblance to recent approaches to Non-maximality (Malamud in Semant Pragmat 5(3):1–58. https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.5.3, 2012; Križ and Spector in Interpreting plural predication: homogeneity and non-maximality, Ms., Institut Jean Nicod, 2017), which enables restating their account of Non-maximality as following from the context-sensitivity of implicature calculation.},

In this paper I argue for a perspective on the ‘pruning’ of alternatives which predicts this generalization, building on the counter-intuitive idea that contradictions are relevant in every context (Lewis 1988).

This note provides a defense of COMPLEXITY. We show that it explains simplex threats once coupled with constraints on questions (‘Partition by Exhaustification’; Fox 2019, 2020) and on assertability of sentences with contextually equivalent alternatives (‘Fatal Competition’; Magri 2009, Bar-Lev and Fox 2023).

It involves what appears to be a conjunctive use of "or": from "You may eat an apple or a pear", we can infer that "You may eat an apple" and that "You may eat a pear" -- though not that "You may eat an apple and a pear". Following Lokhorst (1997), I argue that because permission is a limited resource, a resource-sensitive logic such as Girard's Linear Logic is better suited to modeling permission talk than, say, classical logic. A resource-sensitive approach enables the semantics to track not only that permission has been granted and what sort of permission it is (i.e., permission to eat apples versus permission to eat pears), but also how much permission has been granted, i.e., whether there is enough permission to eat two pieces of fruit or only one. The account here is primarily semantic (as opposed to pragmatic), with no special modes of composition or special pragmatic rules.

This paper explores a related but distinct problem: given a use of a particular sentence in context, why do only some of the expected proportional readings seem to be available? That is, why do some sentences allow an asymmetric reading when other, structurally similar sentences seem to require a symmetric reading? Potential factors suggested in the literature include the distribution of donkey pronouns, certain uniqueness implications, and focus structures. I argue here that the use of an adverbial quantifier presupposes HOMOGENEITY: all individual situations that get lumped into a single case for the purposes of evaluating the quantification must agree on whether they satisfy the nuclear scope. For instance, in order for a token of Usually, if a farmer owns a donkey, he beats it to be felicitous when construed under a farmer-dominant asymmetric reading, the context must be consistent with the proposition that each farmer either beats all or none of his donkeys. Thus proportional sentences are indeed systematically ambiguous, but only some readings will be felicitous in a given context.},

Four-year-olds were shown pictures in which three out of three objects fit a description (e.g., three animals reading), and were asked to evaluate statements that relied on context-independent alternatives (e.g., knowing that all is an alternative to some for the utterance “Some of the animals are reading”) or contextual alternatives (e.g., knowing that the set of all three visible animals is an alternative to a set of two for the utterance “Only the cat and the dog are reading”). Children failed to reject the false statements containing context-independent scales even when the word only was used (e.g., only some), but correctly rejected equivalent statements containing contextual alternatives (e.g., only the cat and dog). These results support the hypothesis that children’s difficulties with scalar implicature are due to a failure to generate relevant alternatives for specific scales. Consequences for number word learning are also discussed.},

We develop and argue for an alternative theory on which CQs are, despite surface appearance, underlyingly matrix questions scoping over a conditional. The input to semantic interpretation is obtained as a result of syntactic reconstruction of the if-clause under the question, an independently needed mechanism. The theory does not necessitate any sophisticated semantics to handle CQs, and we show that it makes correct predictions with respect to diagnostics for reconstruction that surface syntax accounts don’t make. We also argue that the extra semantic machinery employed by previous accounts is harmful in being at risk of over-generating unattested structures, a problem avoided by our account which only makes use of conservative semantics for CQs.},

We show that by treating this non-at-issue level as a presupposition, this theory resolves a number of empirical challenges faced by the old formulation of exh (as well as by standard neo-Gricean theories). The empirical challenges include projection of scalar implicatures from certain embedded environments (‘some under some’ sentences, some under negative factives), their restricted distribution under negation, and the existence of common ground-mismatching and oddness-inducing implicatures. We argue that these puzzles have a uniform solution given a pex-based Grammatical theory of implicatures and some independently motivated principles concerning presupposition projection, cancellation and accommodation.

Multivalence and partiality concerns models in which the dynamics of the interpretation process plays no role, and where the possibility of presupposition failure is tied to the presence of extra truth values in a multivalent semantics. Context dependence and part-time presupposition models are presented in the chapter in which the context of evaluation influences models involving intersentential dynamics where the context of evaluation is modified with each successive utterance. Context change and accommodation theories are discussed in the chapter in which intrasentential dynamics plays a crucial role with sub-sentential constituents being seen as having their own dynamic effects on the context of evaluation used for other constituents, and a process of accommodation allowing presuppositions themselves to produce sophisticated additional modifications.},

In each study, a context question was followed by an answer in which a critical word was either given, new, or contrastively (correctively) focused. Target words were read faster when the critical word provided given information than when it provided new information, and faster when it provided new information than when it corrected prior information. Repetition of target words was controlled in two ways: by mentioning a non-given target word in the context in a relation other than that in which it occurred as a target, and by using a synonym or subordinate of a given target to refer to it in the context question. Verbatim repetition was not responsible for the observed effects of givenness and contrastiveness. Besides clarifying previous inconsistent results of the effects of focus and givenness on reading speed, these results indicate that reading speed can be influenced essentially immediately by a reader’s discourse representation, and that the extent of the influence is graded, with corrections to a representation having a larger effect than simple additions},

This allows us to construe the events in \$\{\textbackslash textit\{Neg\}\}(P)\$ as negative, “anti-\$P\$”, events. Our formalization of \$\{\textbackslash textit\{Neg\}\}\$ is conceptually related to truthmaker semantics but only requires standard logical tools, and it is compatible with standard versions of event semantics. We develop an explicit syntax-semantics interface and compositional analyses of the interaction of negation with disjunction, conjunction, quantifiers, and nonfinite perception reports.},

  abstract = {This book investigates the distribution and interpretation of Covert Modality. Covert Modality is modality which we interpret but which is not associated with any lexical item in the structure that we are interpreting. This dissertation investigates a class of environments that involves covert modality. Examples of covert modality include wh-infinitival complements, infinitival relative clauses, purpose clauses, the 'have to' construction, and the 'is to' construction (cf. 1): 1a. Tim knows [how to solve the problem]. ("Tim knows how one/he could/should solve the problem.") 1b. Jane found [a book to draw cartoons in] for Sara. ("Jane found a book for Sara one could/should draw cartoons in.") 1c. [The man to fix the sink] is here. ("The man whose purpose is to fix the sink is here.") 1d. Sue went to Torino [to buy a violin]. ("Sue went to Torino so that she could buy a violin.") 1e. Bill has to reach Philadelphia before noon. ("Bill must reach Philadelphia before noon.") 1f. Will is to leave tomorrow. ("Will is scheduled/supposed to leave tomorrow.") The interpretation of (1a-f) involves modality; however, there is no lexical item that seems to be the source of the modality. What (1a-f) have in common is that they involve infinitivals. This book addresses the following questions about covert modality: what is the source of this modality, what are its semantic properties, why are some but not all infinitival relatives modal, and why are all infinitival questions modal? The infinitival [+wh] Complementizer is identified as the source of the covert modality. The apparent variability of the force of this modality is related to the particular semantics of this Complementizer. Infinitival relatives that receive a non-modal interpretation are analyzed as being reduced relatives and thus not involving the infinitival [+wh] Complementizer.},

We derive this compositionally from the meaning of the final falling tone and its interaction with the pragmatics of questioning in discourse. Alternative questions are exhaustive in two ways: they exhaust the space of epistemic possibilities, as well as the space of discourse possibilities (the Question Under Discussion). In contrast, we propose that polar questions are the opposite: they present just one alternative that is necessarily non-exhaustive. The account explains a range of response patterns to alternative and polar questions, as well as differences and similarities between the two types of questions.},

Participants read sentences in which target words were in syntactically prominent or syntactically less prominent positions. Across all three experiments, using three types of syntactic prominence manipulations, there were fewer fixations and shorter reading times for words in more prominent positions, indicating that enhanced accessibility of syntactically prominent words is not caused by increased processing time. Rather, syntactic prominence appears to facilitate early encoding/lexical access and sentence integration processes while also, as shown previously, increasing activation of concepts in a comprehender's sentence or discourse representation. We propose that enhanced encoding and sentence integration processes can be attributed to an increase in attentional resources for more prominent concepts, and that this increase derives from readers' immediate sensitivity to informational prominence contours that are signaled by syntax.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the use of possessive morphosyntax to express modal necessity, as in the English use of have to. We claim that possessive modality constructions arise because both possession and necessity express a relation of inclusion between two arguments of the same semantic type: possession involves a relation of inclusion between two 〈e〉-type arguments, while necessity involves inclusion between sets of worlds. Differences between the two arise from their different syntax: possessive have expresses possession via syntactic transitivity, while modals conceal one argument within the modal head. The similarities and differences are captured within a realizational approach to morphology, in which vocabulary items like have and must are inserted to spell out structures consisting of formal features. The proposal is then extended from have-possession languages such as English to be-possession languages, focusing on possessive modality in Hindi-Urdu and Bengali. We argue that the possessive/modal head can be “applicative-like,” licensing oblique case on an argument that raises to its specifier. This account explains why possessive morphosyntax is uniformly used to express modal necessity, and not other modal meanings: the universal force of elements like have (to) follows from the inclusion relation expressed by possession. Possessive modality thus sheds light not only on the semantics of possession but also on the compositional syntax of modal operators.},

However, we argue that this leads to serious overgeneration, for example it predicts that the unacceptable ‘Sue will come to the party, but Bill is sure that she won't and that only Sue will come to the party’ should be equivalent to the acceptable ‘Sue will come to the party, but Bill is sure that nobody will come to the party’. This is because the presupposition triggered by ‘only Sue will come to the party’ should be able to be bound at the matrix level. We discuss some responses to this problem, but argue that they all have shortcomings.},

In this paper, we consider the predictions of Schlenker’s algorithm as applied to attitude verbs. More specifically, we compare Schlenker’s theory with a prominent view which maintains that attitudes exhibit belief projection, so that presupposition triggers in their scope imply that the attitude holder believes the presupposition (Karttunen in Theor Linguist 34(1):181, 1974; Heim in J Semant 9(3):183–221, 1992; Sudo in The art and craft of semantics: a festschrift for Irene Heim, MIT Press, 2014).

The account predicts that a desire report ⌜S wants p⌝ should be true so long as there is some doxastic p-possibility that is most preferred (by S).

  abstract = {This paper argues that two generalizations about person pronouns and agreement point towards a semantic account where both exhaustification and cumulative coordination can apply word-internally. Both generalizations involve reference to pluralities that include both the author and the addressee for which many languages use an inclusive first person morph distinct from exclusive first person and second person. The first generalization (originally due to Zwicky 1977, CLS Proceedings) holds that in terms of person categories, in languages that lack an inclusive/exclusive contrast the inclusive neutralizes with the first person and never the second person, despite overlapping meaning with both. The second generalization, which we argue is exemplified by Mandarin and Daur, is that in languages which mark clusivity only in some subsystems, but not others, then not only will the inclusive meaning be expressed as a first (not second) person, but where there are common forms between the (sub)systems, then it will be the exclusive, not the inclusive that expresses the general first person in environments that lack a clusivity contrast. Our account assumes only the two person features AUTHOR and PARTICIPANT, but uses exhaustivization instead of feature negation or Maximize Presuppostion and assumes that feature conjunction can be cumulative coordination. By analyzing the first person inclusive as AUTHOR cumulatively conjoined with exhaustivized PARTICIPANT, we derive the two generalizations noted.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses two long-standing issues concerning focus: first, the question of whether the focal interpretation is directly read off the prosodic structure of a sentence, or it is rather mediated by a [focus] feature encoded in the syntactic representation; second, whether interrogative wh-phrases are inherently endowed with a [focus] feature. We provide evidence from two prosodic experiments on direct wh-questions in Italian, showing that the Nuclear Pitch Accent (NPA) and main stress fall on the lexical verb, without a concomitant focal interpretation of the latter. Furthermore, we show that NPA assignment is sensitive to the derivational history of the wh-phrase under short-distance vs. long-distance extraction. We account for the observed NPA distribution in terms of a [focus] feature which is bundled with the [wh] in direct questions, and is specified on each phase head that hosts in its edge one link of the wh-chain. Thus, v° is specified for the feature bundle \{wh, focus\} and attracts the assignment of the NPA, which is then realized on the lexical verb. Our findings, thus, cast doubt on the direct association between prosodic prominence and a focal interpretation.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates syntax and semantics of attitude and speech reports. It is concerned with three questions: (i) what kinds of meanings can tensed embedded clauses have? (ii) how are they integrated into the argument structure of verbs? (ii) why does their distribution sometimes depend not only on the argument structure, but on the embedding environment as well?    Chapter 1 provides a brief summary of my proposal and outlines the assumed framework.  Chapter 2 examines clauses that combine with nouns like 'claim' and 'situation' in Buryat, Korean and Russian. It argues that displacement in attitude and speech reports comes from a projection ContP in the left periphery of embedded clauses (cf. Kratzer 2006, Bogal-Allbritten 2016, a.o.), and clauses differ in whether they have ContP and thus displacement. I also argue for equality semantics of displacement (Moulton 2009, Elliott 2017): clausal embedding does not involve semantics of a universal modal. Chapter 3 examines conjunction and disjunction of embedded CPs, and shows that interpretations of these structures, as well as the impossibility of true CP conjunction follow from my proposal. Chapter 4 investigates how nominalized and bare CPs are integrated with verbs in Buryat, Korean and Russian, and shows that they systematically receive different interpretations. I argue that this difference emerges because while nominalized CPs are arguments of verbs, bare CPs are always modifiers. I show that the integration path of an embedded CP, as well as its internal structure, matter for whether it is transparent for extraction or behaves like an island. Chapter 5 examines two types of polarity subjunctives in Russian: embedded subjunctive clauses whose ability to occur with certain verbs depends on the entailment properties of the environment. I argue that the subjunctive particle activates alternatives which have to be acted upon by a higher focus operator, and intervening projections, including ContP, can change the set of alternatives that the operator receives, making the sentence L-analytic and thus ungrammatical (Gajewski 2002, a.o.) in some cases but not in others.  Chapter 6 summarizes the findings of the thesis, and the typology of tensed embedded clauses that it gives rise to.},

Our empirical focus is on a puzzle discovered by Sharvit (to appear) concerning Negative Polarity Item (NPI) licensing in nominal arguments to monotonic attitude verbs; neither a standard Hintikkan account of attitude verbs, nor Kratzer’s (2006) content-based semantics satisfactorily accounts for Sharvit’s puzzle. Instead, we pursue the idea that monotonicity is a consequence of the part-whole structure of contentful entities; specifically, we achieve monotonicity by constraining how the part-whole structure of attitudinal eventualities relates to the part-whole structure of their contents, as well as the part-whole structure of their themes. In order to cash out this idea, we rely on a non-monotonic equality-based semantics for clausal embedding (Moulton 2009, Elliott 2017, Bassi \& Bondarenko 2021, Bondarenko 2022). By developing a more flexible account of monotonicity in attitude reports, we thereby resolve Sharvit’s puzzle in a way broadly consistent with a content-based semantics for clausal embedding.},

The generalization is shown to follow from an interaction of independently motivated assumptions concerning the structure of floating quantifier constructions and the mechanism of adjunction. The analysis of quantifier float proposed in the paper is shown to have important consequences for a number of issues and phenomena, including clausal structure, PP structure, object shift, cliticization, V-movement, Case licensing, small clauses, scope reconstruction, pied-piping, and heavy NP shift. Regarding PP structure, the paper pursues the clause/PP parallelism hypothesis: It is shown that there is a clause/PP parallelism with respect to Case-licensing, V/P movement, cliticization, and object shift.},

  abstract = {This article presents a method to construct event semantic representations incrementally from left to right. The proposed theory focusses on the interaction between events and other scope taking expressions, in particular quantificational DPs and adverbials that are sensitive to aspect. Psycholinguistic experiments have revealed that semantic mismatches can be detected as early as their lexical triggers are encountered, without waiting for a complete semantic or syntactic representation. Our theory thus provides for ‘incomplete’ representations that nonetheless allow for an immediate explanation of such mismatches, right at the point where left to right parsing detects the offending triggers. Viewed from a broader perspective, our framework can be seen as a logical background for theories of semantic parsing in general. In contrast to existing implementations of incremental interpretation, we only employ a single compositional processing rule, namely functional composition of only one logical type of expressions. On the other hand, for this (otherwise unmatched) uniformity to work, we rely on advanced semantic techniques like continuations, dynamic binding and unrestricted β-reduction (cf. Barker 2002; Gronendijk \&amp; Stokhof 1991; Klein \&amp; Sternefeld 2013, respectively). In the context of adverbials, these methods can be shown to interact in a non-trivial way with the mereology of events as proposed in Krifka (1992).},

  abstract = {When Tarzan asks Jane Do you like my friends? and Jane answers Some of them, her underinformative reply implicates Not all of them. This scalar inference arises when a less-than-maximally informative utterance implies the denial of a more informative proposition. Default Inference accounts (e.g., Levinson, 1983, Levinson, 2000) argue that this inference is linked to lexical items (e.g., some) and is generated automatically and largely independently of context. Alternatively, Relevance theory (Sperber \& Wilson, 1985/1995) treats such inferences as contextual and as arriving effortfully with deeper processing of utterances. We compare these accounts in four experiments that employ a sentence verification paradigm. We focus on underinformative sentences, such as Some elephants are mammals, because these are false with a scalar inference and true without it. Experiment 1 shows that participants are less accurate and take significantly longer to answer correctly when instructions call for a Some but not all interpretation rather than a Some and possibly all interpretation. Experiment 2, which modified the paradigm of Experiment 1 so that correct responses to both interpretations resulted in the same overt response, reports results that confirm those of the first Experiment. Experiment 3, which imposed no interpretations, reveals that those who employed a Some but not all reading to the underinformative items took longest to respond. Experiment 4 shows that the rate of scalar inferences increased as permitted response time did. These results argue against a Neo-Gricean account and in favor of Relevance theory.},

We broaden the debate between VSA and SA by focusing on a new strengthening principle, Strengthening with a Possibility. We show dynamic SA classically validates this principle. We give a counterexample to it and show that extra dynamic resources cannot help SA. We then show VSA accounts for the counterexample if it allows for orderings on worlds that are not almost-connected, and that such an ordering naturally falls out of a Kratzerian ordering source semantics. We conclude that the failure of Strengthening with a Possibility tells strongly against Dynamic SA and in favor of an ordering source-based version of VSA.},

  abstract = {This thesis deals with a number of puzzles related to word order, in which the co-occurence of two elements in the same clause imposes a restriction on the distribution of these elements. I suggest that elements involved in Agree relationships [Chomsky (2000, 2001)] are subject to a requirement that they be aligned with the left or right edge of a prosodic phrase, following work done in Richards (2016). I argue that there is a restriction on the opaque satisfaction of this requirement, and show that this provides a unified solution to these word order puzzles. Chapters 1 and 2 deal with movement phenomena, primarily in left-headed languages. In chapter 1, I show that some languages allow A-movement of subjects across other DPs, whereas others do not. I note that this appears to be determined by which edge of a prosodic phrase they require phrases in Agree relationships to be aligned with, and show that this is a consequence of the proposed restriction on opaque satisfaction of the alignment requirement. Chapter 2 builds on the results of chapter 1. I show that A-movement of a subject may cross another nominal in all languages, but only if there is a phase boundary between the launch site and landing site, and show how this falls out from the proposed restriction on opacity. I show also that languages that do not allow A-movement of subjects across other DPs display a similar restriction in wh-questions, and argue that this too is a result of the proposed restriction on opacity. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the distribution of wh-phrases in languages that allow them to remain in-situ. Chapter 3 deals with co-occurance restrictions between foci and wh-phrases. I argue that these restrictions emerge as a result of a conflict between a prosodic strategy that languages might use to satisfy the alignment requirement, called Grouping, and the proposed restriction on opaque satisfaction of this requirement. Chapter 4 deals with Grouping more generally. I show that languages with Grouping have a particular prosodic signature which marks phonological phrases that contain wh-phrases, whereas languages that lack Grouping do not, and explore the consequences of this for the architecture developed in this thesis.},

  abstract = {Providing a compositional interpretation procedure for discourses in which descriptions of complex dependencies between interrelated objects are incrementally built is a key challenge for natural language semantics. This article focuses on the interactions between the entailment particle therefore, modalized conditionals and modal subordination. It shows that the dependencies between individuals and possibilities that emerge out of such interactions can receive a unified compositional account in a system couched in classical type logic that integrates and simplifies van den Berg's dynamic plural logic and the classical Lewis–Kratzer analysis of modal quantification. The main proposal is that modal quantification is a composite notion, to be decomposed in terms of discourse reference to quantificational dependencies that is multiply constrained by the various components that make up a modal quantifier. The system captures the truth-conditional and anaphoric components of modal quantification in an even-handed way and, unlike previous accounts, makes the propositional contents contributed by modal constructions available for subsequent discourse reference.},

  abstract = {The paper argues that two distinct and independent notions of plurality are involved in natural language anaphora and quantification: plural reference (the usual non-atomic individuals) and plural discourse reference, i.e., reference to a quantificational dependency between sets of objects (e.g., atomic/non-atomic individuals) that is established and subsequently elaborated upon in discourse. Following van den Berg (PhD dissertation, University of Amsterdam, 1996), plural discourse reference is modeled as plural information states (i.e., as sets of variable assignments) in a new dynamic system couched in classical type logic that extends Compositional DRT (Muskens, Linguistics and Philosophy, 19, 143–186, 1996). Given the underlying type logic, compositionality at sub-clausal level follows automatically and standard techniques from Montague semantics become available. The idea that plural info states are semantically necessary (in addition to non-atomic individuals) is motivated by relative-clause donkey sentences with multiple instances of singular donkey anaphora that have mixed (weak and strong) readings. At the same time, allowing for non-atomic individuals in addition to plural info states enables us to capture the intuitive parallels between singular and plural (donkey) anaphora, while deriving the incompatibility between singular (donkey) anaphora and collective predicates. The system also accounts for empirically unrelated phenomena, e.g., the uniqueness effects associated with singular (donkey) anaphora discussed in Kadmon (Linguistics and Philosophy, 13, 273–324, 1990) and Heim (Linguistics and Philosophy, 13, 131–177, 1990) among others.},

  abstract = {This study investigates how pitch accent type and additive particles affect the activation of contrastive alternatives. In Experiment 1, German listeners heard declarative utterances (e.g., The swimmer wanted to put on flippers) and saw four printed words displayed on screen: one that was a contrastive alternative to the subject noun (e.g., diver), one that was non-contrastively related (e.g., pool), the object (e.g., flippers), and an unrelated distractor. Experiment 1 manipulated pitch accent type, comparing a broad focus control condition to two narrow focus conditions: with a contrastive or non-contrastive accent on the subject noun (nuclear L+H* vs. H+L*, respectively, followed by deaccentuation). In Experiment 2, the utterances in the narrow focus conditions were preceded by the unstressed additive particle auch (“also”), which may trigger alternatives itself. It associated with the accented subject. Results showed that, compared to the control condition, participants directed more fixations to the contrastive alternative when the subject was realized with a contrastive accent (nuclear L+H*) than when it was realized with non-contrastive H+L*, while additive particles had no effect. Hence, accent type is the primary trigger for signaling the presence of alternatives (i.e., contrast). Implications for theories of information structure and the processing of additive particles are discussed.},

Their move is motivated by the desire to accommodate radical forms of context sensitivity within a systematic account of natural languages. In this paper I argue against weakening compositionality in the way proposed by them. I argue that weak compositionality fails to provide some of the expected benefits of compositionality. First, weak compositionality fails to provide systematic meaning-rules which can handle forms of context-sensitivity that are not amenable to explanation in terms of a fixed and limited set of contextual parameters. Secondly, I argue that weak-compositionality fails to play any role in explaining speakers’ ability to calculate the semantic values of complex expressions. I conclude that weak compositionality is not a viable alternative to standard interpretations of compositionality, and that it doesn’t offer an acceptable way to accommodate radical forms of context-sensitivity within a systematic account of natural languages. Given the central role that weak-compositionality plays in recent approaches to natural language (e.g. in truth-conditional pragmatics) this also casts doubt on the viability of these projects.},

But why we are justified in relying on intuitive judgements as evidence for grammars? In the philosophy of linguistics, this question has been hotly debated. I argue that the three most prominent views of that debate all have their problems. Devitt’s Modest Explanation accounts for the wrong kind of intuitive judgements. The Voice of Competence view and Rey’s account both lack independent evidence. I introduce and defend a novel proposal that accounts for the evidential role of linguistic intuitive judgements and avoids these shortcomings. On this account, linguistic intuitive judgements are reports of the speaker’s immediate experience of trying to comprehend the sentence. This experience is due to the speaker’s linguistic competence, at least in part, and so the justification for the evidential use of linguistic intuitions ultimately comes from the speaker’s competence. However, the account does not rely on any special input from the speaker’s competence being available as the basis for linguistic intuitive judgements.},

We present data from Vietnamese which indicate that wh-in situ can be interpreted by either covert movement or unselective binding without movement. Covert movement takes place in matrix questions that lack a question particle, while unselective binding is used when there is a question particle and in embedded questions generally. The Vietnamese data also show that covert movement observes the same constraints—in particular, Subjacency—as overt movement. The correlation between unselective binding and the question particle in matrix questions appears to support recent theoretical views of question particles (e.g., Cheng, 1991), but we argue that this is only apparent. The question particle merely serves a syntactic licensing function, and this function is borne by a question-embedding verb in embedded questions, meaning that it is not inherent to question particles as such. The question particle in Vietnamese actually serves an unrelated semantic function: it indicates realis mood and induces a presupposition. The implication is that question particles are only indirectly related to wh-in situ, if they are related at all.},

The publications supporting the obligatory narrow scope of bare nominals in a wide range of typologically different languages vastly outnumber the ones that claim the opposite. In this paper, we survey the facts from the literature, work out how the kinds approach deals with them, and identify scrambled bare plurals as the ultimate challenge for the kinds approach. Dutch examples illustrate that scrambled bare plurals unambiguously take wide scope with respect to quantifiers and negation, while maintaining kind reference. The kinds approach proves unable to derive the wide scope reading of bare plurals under a surface-oriented composition of scrambled objects. Once we abandon the default kind shift, following Krifka (2004), and allow bare plurals to directly shift to an existential interpretation, we can easily derive the wide scope reading with a local type repair. We conclude that a flexible type shifting approach to bare nominals is preferred over a default kind shift for empirical reasons. EARLY ACCESS},

And this has consequences: words we decide not to pronounce have critical effects on the messages we end up conveying. For instance, in saying Chris is a good teacher, we may convey that Chris is not an amazing teacher. How this happens is an unsolvable problem, unless a theory of alternatives indicates what counts, among all the things that have not been pronounced. It is sometimes assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that any word counts, as long as that word could have replaced one that was actually pronounced. We review arguments for going beyond this powerful idea. In doing so, we argue that the level of words is not the right (or at least not the only) level of analysis for alternatives. Instead, we capitalize on recent conceptual and associated methodological advances within the study of the so-called “language of thought” to reopen the problem from a new perspective. Specifically, we provide theoretical and experimental arguments that the relation between alternatives and words may be indirect, and that alternatives are not merely linguistic objects in the traditional sense. Rather, we propose that competition in language is significantly determined by general reasoning preferences, or thought preferences (preferences that may have forged the lexicons of modern languages in the first place, as argued elsewhere). We propose that such non-linguistic preferences can be measured and that these measures can be used to explain linguistic competition, non-linguistically, and more in depth.},

When they combine with distributive predicates, they intuitively impose a kind of upper bound, whereas when they combine with non-distributive predicates, they do not (they sometimes even impose a lower bound). We propose and explore in detail four solutions to this puzzle, each involving some notion of maximality, but differing in the type of maximality involved (‘standard’ maximality versus ‘informativity-based’ maximality) and in the source of maximality (lexically encoded in the meaning of the numeral modifier versus non-lexical). While the full range of data we consider do not conclusively favor one theory over the other three, we do argue that overall the evidence (i) goes against the view that modified numerals lexically encode a ‘standard’ maximality operator, and (ii) suggests the need for a pragmatic blocking mechanism that filters out readings (logical forms) of sentences that are generated by the grammar but intuitively unavailable.},

  abstract = {Ordinary superlative descriptions are well-known to provide safe harbor to negative polarity items (NPIs), as in the longest book anyone read. What is less well-known is that relative superlative descriptions also sometimes host NPIs, as in the loudest that anyone sang. We observe that this latter pattern is more general than has been previously described. In fact, relative superlatives can license NPIs outside of their own descriptions. On the one hand, we argue that this provides evidence that the superlative adjectives take sentential rather than nominal scope. But on the other, following insights in Howard 2014, we argue that traditional semantic accounts of scope-taking superlatives do not present the right monotonicity profile to account for the NPIs either. A recent, dynamic take on superlative semantics (Bumford 2017) is shown to do better.},

Vagueness-based approaches derive the comparative from the positive, and face non-trivial challenges with incommensurability and non-GA comparatives. Classic degree-based approaches effectively derive the positive from the comparative, out of sync with the direction of evidence from morphology, and create some difficulties in accounting for GA scale-mates with differing thresholds (e.g., 'cold' ∼ 'warm' ∼ 'hot'). We propose a new reconciliation that capitalizes on recent proposals analyzing GAs as predicates of states. On our account, GAs lexically involve both a threshold property and a background state structure. Positive occurrences of GAs make use of the threshold property, while comparative occurrences make use of degrees representing elements of the background structure. Our approach preserves the virtues of classic degree-based approaches while offering a natural account of scale-mates, and without appeal to covert morphemes like POS or related devices. As we show, it is possible to inject our solution back into the classic degree-based approach, but we find reasons to prefer our states-based account.},

We explore various precise formulations of this principle, consider arguments in its favour, and explain how it interacts with different conceptions of evidence and accuracy. As we show, the principle has some noteworthy consequences for the wider theory of knowledge. First, it implies that an agent cannot be justified in believing a set of mutually inconsistent claims. Second, it implies the existence of a kind of epistemic blindspot: it is not possible to know that one’s evidence is misleading.},

While the antecedent of a premise conditional is thematic, the antecedent of a hypothetical conditional can also be rhematic. Rhematic conditionals happen to be compatible with all the characteristics that stand out as incompatible with premise conditionals.

This paper investigates and formalizes different sources of covert distributivity. Apart from lexical distributivity effects, which are modeled by meaning postulates, phrasal distributivity is captured via two covert operators: (i) a D operator distributing over atoms only (Link 1987), and (ii) a cover-based Part operator, which can also distribute over nonatomic pluralities under contextual licensing (Schwarzschild 1996). The resulting theory surpasses accounts in which nonatomic distributivity is freely available, or not available at all; furthermore, it correctly predicts differences between lexical and phrasal nonatomic distributivity. D and Part are reformulated in Neo-Davidsonian algebraic event semantics, so that they apply to event predicates and make the sum event available for further modification by arguments and adjuncts. This paves the way for an account of the context-dependency of distributivity phenomena under for-adverbials, which improves on theories that predict indefinites to either always or never covary with for-adverbials. The paper and its companion include an explicit proposal for the compositional process in event semantics. BibTeX info},

We extend the pragmatic theory of non-maximality in plural definites by Križ (2016) to explain how hearers use Questions under Discussion to fix the interpretation of donkey sentences in context. We propose that the denotations of such sentences involve truthvalue gaps — in certain scenarios the sentences are neither true nor false —and demonstrate that Križ’s pragmatic theory fills these gaps to generate the standard judgments of the literature. Building on Muskens’s (1996) Compositional Discourse Representation Theory and on ideas from supervaluation semantics, we define a general schema for dynamic quantification that delivers the required truth-value gaps. Given the independently motivated pragmatic theory of Križ 2016, we argue that mixed readings of donkey sentences require neither plural information states, contra Brasoveanu 2008, 2010, nor error states, contra Champollion 2016, nor singular donkey pronouns with plural referents, contra Krifka 1996, Yoon 1996.

Our basic idea is inspired by exhaustification-based models of free choice (Fox 2007) and by game-theoretic accounts based on iterated best response (Franke 2011). We assume that when the speaker utters You may take an apple or a pear, the hearer reasons about why the speaker did not choose alternative utterances such as You may take an apple. A crucial ingredient in our explanation is the idea of semantic uncertainty (Bergen, Levy \&amp; Goodman 2016). Specifically, we assume that the speaker is uncertain whether or not the hearer will interpret You may take an apple as forbidding them from taking a pear. This uncertainty can be thought of as resulting from Fox’s (2007) optional covert exhaustification. Uttering the disjunction is a way for the speaker to prevent the hearer from concluding that any fruit is forbidden to take. Knowing this, the hearer concludes that they may choose either fruit.},

For example, it has been claimed to be problematic for semantic accounts of quantification (Beaver and Condoravdi, in: Aloni et~al. (eds.) Proceedings of the 16th Amsterdam Colloquium, 2007), for classical accounts of negation (Krifka, in: Bartsch et~al. (eds.) Semantics and contextual expression, 1989), and for intersective accounts of verbal coordination (Lasersohn, in Plurality, conjunction and events, 1995). This paper shows that none of this is the case, once we abandon the idea that the event variable is bound at sentence level, and assume instead that verbs denote existential quantifiers over events. Quantificational arguments can then be given a semantic account, negation can be treated classically, and coordination can be modeled as intersection. The framework presented here is a natural choice for researchers and fieldworkers who wish to sketch a semantic analysis of a language without being forced to make commitments about the hierarchical order of arguments, the argument-adjunct distinction, the default scope of quantifiers, or the nature of negation and coordination.},

  abstract = {Fine (2017a) develops a unilateral and a bilateral truthmaker semantics for propositional logic. The unilateral approach trades off the primitive exact falsification relation of the bilateral approach for a primitive exclusion relation between states, thereby raising the question if exclusion serves any purpose other than to avoid exact falsification. We argue that exclusion is motivated independently of its use in avoiding exact falsification, namely as a foundation for the reconstruction of modal notions such as possibility and necessity. This reconstruction in turn motivates what we call emergent exclusion: an atomic state can exclude a sum of atomic states collectively without excluding any of these atomic states individually. Emergent exclusion is banned in Fine (2017a) in order to maintain exact equivalence in de Morgan’s Law ¬(P ∧ Q) ⇔ ¬P ∨ ¬Q; we argue that the two sides of this law are not exactly equivalent and discuss a variety of state spaces that feature emergent exclusion. This paper aims to be accessible to linguists without prior exposure to truthmaker semantics. We highlight points of contact with linguistic semantics, such as event semantics and algebraic semantics of plurals and conjunction.},

This paper describes and explains observable cross-linguistic differences in overt distributive items in the framework of Neo-Davidsonian algebraic event semantics. The previous paper, Champollion 2016, postulated two covert distributivity operators, D and Part, in the grammar, even though the semantic effects of D can be subsumed under the workings of Part. This paper motivates the split by arguing that distance-distributive items across languages are in essence overt versions of these operators. For example, English each lexicalizes D while German jeweils lexicalizes Part. For this reason, jeweils occurs in a wider range of distributive environments, including distribution over salient occasions. The proposed analysis explains why distributive items that can also be used as determiners, such as each and every, never allow distribution over occasions. It also accounts for the ability of these determiners to take part in cumulative readings and to interact with nondistributive event modifiers. The paper and its companion include an explicit proposal for the compositional process in event semantics. BibTeX info},

This theory has been successfully applied to coordination of other kinds of constituents ( Partee \&amp; Rooth 1983 ; Winter 2001 ). Certain cases of noun coordination ( men and women ) challenge this view, and have therefore been argued to favor the collective theory ( Heycock \&amp; Zamparelli 2005 ). The main result of this article is that the intersective theory actually predicts the collective behavior of and in men and women . And leads to collectivity by interacting with silent operators involving set minimization and choice functions, which have been postulated to account for phenomena involving indefinites, collective predicates and coordinations of noun phrases ( Winter 2001 ). This article also shows that the collective theory does not generalize to coordinations of noun phrases in the way it has been previously suggested.},

I show that the formal pressures that characterize the interaction of PA and alternatives apply equally to ∃-closure and alternatives, and that it is accordingly impossible to define a true ∃-closure operation within what might be termed “standard” AS. A well-behaved AS reflex of ∃-closure can only be defined in compositional settings where a well-behaved AS reflex of PA is definable too. I consider various technical and empirical consequences of these points for Griffiths’s theory of ellipsis, and for linguistic theory more generally.},

English or French self-forms (her-self / elle-même) can be anaphors (and logophors) or intensifiers, a common crosslinguistic synchronic pattern (Gast and Siemund 2006), with well documented cases of diachronic genesis (König and Siemund 2005) suggesting that this pattern is non-accidental. In addition, English self and cognates in other languages (but not French même) can be prefixed to predicates (e.g., self-immolate) with correlated interpretive effects. Chomsky’s 1986 binding theory or Charnavel and Sportiche (2016) fails to explain why anaphors are anaphors, why e.g. there is a condition A they are subject to, and does not address the relation between reflexives and intensifiers. Alternatives (Cresswell 1973, Reuland 2011, Lechner 2012, Sauerland 2013, McKillen 2016) do try to address some of these questions but are unsatisfactory (see Sportiche 2022b). Unlike most previous work (but like Browning 1993, e.g.), we start from the requirement that a single lexical entry for self is to be postulated that organically explains the dual use of self-forms as reflexives and as intensifiers, and all their properties: we propose a lexical entry for self/même, attempting, in interaction with independent principles, to derive (i) why self forms like herself are anaphoric (or logophoric) reflexives, (ii) why they are subject to Condition A of the Binding Theory, (iii) why the reflexive interpretations of self predicates and of pronominal reflexives systematically differ, particularly in attitudes contexts, (iv) why they are used as intensifiers, (v) why qua intensifiers, they display particular distributional restrictions and interpretations (cf. e.g. Eckardt 2001, Gast 2006, Ahn 2010).  The central idea is that self is a binary predicate with two arguments α and the pronoun β, and, as standard, a (quasi) identity function on its first argument (self (β ) ≈ β ). Relativizing α yields intensification; Moving it to a θ position yields reflexivization.  In principle, this analysis extends to a wide variety of languages displaying the same homophony, and provides natural grounds for treating `Case Copying Reflexive’ found in languages like Malayam or Telugu (see Jayaseelan 1996, Messick and Ragotham 2024)},

Based on a new observation about the homogeneity properties of cumulative readings of every, I argue that the homogeneity properties of cumulative readings arise from the interaction of multiple operators, each operator contributing one exhaustive participation inference which disappears in negative contexts. I identify these operators with the thematic role heads in a Neo-Davidsonian semantics. The resulting theory is able to predict the homogeneity properties of cumulative sentences from the homogeneity properties of their arguments and the position of these arguments.},

This dissertation proposes a new theory of these cumulative readings that connects them to the phenomenon of homogeneity. Specifically, taking inspiration from Bar-Lev (2018), I argue that predicates sometimes have weak existential meanings, which are revealed when placed under negation. The stronger meaning observed in positive sentences are the result of a procedure of exhaustification. By recognizing predicates' underlying weak meanings and their liability to strengthening, cumulative reading of quantifiers can be accounted for by maintaining relatively standard assumptions about composition. This analysis predicts a range of intricate cases, including Schein's famous video-game examples. It also predicts the truth-conditions of negative cumulative sentences and asymmetries in the availability of cumulative readings of quantifiers.},

This paper presents two new data points going against standard dynamic approaches to this ambiguity: first, I show that the ambiguity extends beyond quantified environments, to cross-clausal anaphora. Second, I show that donkey sentences can give rise to narrow pseudo-scope readings, where the pronoun's implicit quantification takes scope below some operator in the sentence. Neither of these facts is predicted by standard dynamic accounts. Together, they suggest a different analysis in which the ambiguity arises when the pronoun has multiple referents to pick from. Inspired by Champollion (2017), I propose that when such circumstances arise, the pronoun receives vague reference. Using standard rules of projection is then sufficient to derive the existential/universal ambiguity as well as the two problematic data points.},

  abstract = {A key breakthrough in research on the semantics/pragmatics interface was the discovery of ‘locally computed’ scalar implicatures. While initial accounts modified the interpretive procedure to account for them (Chierchia 2004), the dominant view is now that local implicatures are computed by an invisible but syntactically real version of only, the exhaustivity operator Exh (Chierchia, Fox, and Spector 2012). We argue that all current accounts (including the operator-based view) are faced with a challenge because some expressions display a Janus-faced behavior: they simultaneously seem to include and to exclude Exh. Take the discourse 'Syldavia will invade Spain or Portugal. But Biden doubts it.' The first sentence is naturally understood to mean that Syldavia will invade Spain or Portugal but not both, but the second sentence means that Biden doubts that Syldavia will invade Spain or Portugal (or both). We uncover several types of Janus sentences of this sort using anaphora and (in an appendix) using ellipsis and embedding under unlike. Janus sentences are found with unaccented scalar terms, but usually not with controls involving overt only or accented scalar terms. Without solving the puzzle, we discuss one broad solution strategy, which consists in complicating the semantics of the exhaustivity operator so that it can always be present, but with semantic effects that are systematically trivialized in some environments.},

  abstract = {[NEW TITLE: Local Pragmatics Redux: Presupposition Accommodation Without Covert Operators] On several occasions in recent linguistic research, operations that used to be considered part of pragmatics were syntacticized: a covert operator was postulated to enrich the meaning of some constituents as part of compositional semantics. Two cases in point are Chierchia, Fox and Spector's exhaustivity operator O, used to compute local implicatures; and Bochvar's assertation operator A, used to compute local accommodation of presuppositions. A key benefit of syntacticization is to explain why these operations can be performed in the scope of various operators, something that is not easy to conceptualize within standard Gricean pragmatics. But are these operators syntactically real? We offer a case study of the operator A. Using tests based on ellipsis, we argue that it is not syntactically real. In the spirit of Recanati's 'free enrichment', we develop an alternative analysis of presupposition accommodation. It is based on a generalization of domain restriction, which we take to apply not just to nominal elements but, when needed, to verbal elements as well. Besides this result, our analysis raises a more general question: Which pragmatic operators are syntactically real and which are not? NOTE: The original manuscript also discussed (i) the exhaustivity operator, and (ii) Blumberg and Goldstein's operator R. An expanded version of Part (i) is now accepted with minor revisions in Journal of Semantics ("Janus Sentences: A Puzzle for Theories of Local Implicatures."). An expanded version of Part (ii) is now accepted with minor revisions in Rivista di Grammatica Generativa ("On the Syntactic Reality of Pragmatic Operators: the Case of Non-Redundancy").},

This typology is mostly based on traditional linguistic means, such as introspective judgments about phrases occurring in different constructions, in different conversational contexts. More recently, the processing properties of these inferences have also been studied (see, e.g., recent work showing that scalar implicatures is a costly phenomenon). Our focus is on free choice permission, a phenomenon by which conjunctive inferences are unexpectedly added to disjunctive sentences. For instance, a sentence such as “Mary is allowed to eat an ice-cream or a cake” is normally understood as granting permission both for eating an ice-cream and for eating a cake. We provide data from four processing studies, which show that, contrary to arguments coming from the theoretical literature, free choice inferences are different from scalar implicatures.},

As a quantifier,dou quantifies over regular NPs (plural). As a binder,dou provides quantificational force forwh-polarity items, which do not have inherent quantificational force. I argue that the locality restrictions associated withdou varies depending on the element it is associated with. With regular NPs, the locality is reflected by LF adjunction ofdou. Withwh-polarity items, the locality is restricted by licensing of polarity items as well as its ability as a binder.},

They claim that all three types of conditionals (rúguǒ-, dōu- and bare conditionals) allow either a wh-phrase or a pronoun in the consequent clause, and that both the wh-phrase and the pronoun may be either unselectively bound or interpreted by the E-type strategy. We show that, except for an observation already mentioned and accommodated in Cheng and Huang’s (1996) analysis of rúguǒ-conditionals, their distributional claims are incorrect. It is also shown that the interpretative flexibility they propose is untenable, as it leaves a number of otherwise well-predicted properties unaccounted for.},

It serves all the functions characteristic of representative stages of grammaticalization from a numeral to a generalized indefinite determiner as elaborated in the literature. It is established in this paper that the Chinese indefinite determiner has developed a special use with definite expressions, serving as a backgrounding device marking entities as of low thematic importance and unlikely to receive subsequent mentions in ensuing discourse. ‘yi+classifier’ in the special use with definite expressions displays striking similarities in terms of semantic bleaching and phonological reduction with the same determiner at the advanced stage of grammaticalization characterized by uses with generics, nonspecifics and nonreferentials. An explanation is offered in terms of an implicational relation between nonreferentiality and low thematic importance which characterize the two uses of the indefinite determiner. While providing another piece of evidence in support of the claim that semantically nonreferentials and entities of low thematic importance tend to be encoded in terms of same linguistic devices in language, findings in this paper have shown how an indefinite determiner can undergo a higher degree of grammaticalization than has been reported in the literature—it expands its scope to mark not only indefinite but also definite expressions as semantically nonreferential and/or thematically unimportant.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates the non-uniformity of Chinese wh-indefinites. The different algebraic structures associated with the different wh-indefinites are shown to play a significant role in determining their possible readings. Specifically, those wh-indefinites that are associated with an unordered algebraic structure can give rise to an epistemic reading in both positive and negative sentences. Those wh-indefinites that are associated with a structure of total ordering never have an epistemic reading. They have an existential reading in positive sentences and generate an insignificance reading under a clausemate negation. Shenme ‘what’ is a special in that it straddles both types of wh-indefinites. When it is interpreted as kind-denoting, it is associated with an unordered structure and has an epistemic reading; when it is degree-denoting, however, it is associated with a structure of total ordering, leading to an insignificance reading under a clausemate negation. The proposed analysis through the lens of algebraic structure not only accounts for the non-uniformity of Chinese wh-indefinites, but also sheds light on the semantics of the particles that interact with the wh-indefinites. The multi-functional particle dou is an example. Two different groups of theories have been proposed to explain its different uses. The first group analyzes dou as a distributor and the second takes it to be semantically equivalent to English even. Bringing in the insights of the algebraic theory of Chinese wh-indefinites, I argue that the second group of theories is on the wrong track.},

Specifically,~on the one hand, we follow Liu 2017 in arguing that (a)~dou~is uniformly a scalar~particle, (b) it operates on distinct types of alternatives on distinct readings and~(c) a trivialization operation occurs on the distributive reading; on the other hand,~we, deviating from Liu, adopt two components adapted from the gradability-based~semantics originally suggested for Englishevenin Greenberg 2018a, i.e. (a) anevaluative presupposition and (b) a contextually determined scale, instead of one~based on unlikelihood.

  abstract = {The mass/count distinction attracts a lot of attention among cognitive scientists, possibly because it involves in fundamental ways the relation between language (i.e. grammar), thought (i.e. extralinguistic conceptual systems) and reality (i.e. the physical world). In the present paper, I explore the view that the mass/count distinction is a matter of vagueness. While every noun/concept may in a sense be vague, mass nouns/concepts are vague in a way that systematically impairs their use in counting. This idea has never been systematically pursued, to the best of my knowledge. I make it precise relying on supervaluations (more specifically, ‘data semantics’) to model it. I identify a number of universals pertaining to how the mass/count contrast is encoded in the languages of the world, along with some of the major dimensions along which languages may vary on this score. I argue that the vagueness based model developed here provides a useful perspective on both. The outcome (besides shedding light on semantic variation) seems to suggest that vagueness is not just an interface phenomenon that arises in the interaction of Universal Grammar (UG) with the Conceptual/Intentional System (to adopt Chomsky’s terminology), but it is actually part of the architecture of UG.},

  abstract = {Approaches to anaphora generally seek to explain the potential for a DP to covary with a pronoun in terms of a combination of factors, such as (i) the inherent semantics of the antecedent DP (i.e., whether it is indefinite, quantificational, referential), (ii) its scope properties, and (iii) its structural position. A case in point is Reinhart’s classic condition on bound anaphora, paraphrasable as A DP can antecede a pronoun pro only if the DP c-commands pro at S-structure, supplemented with some extra machinery to allow indefinites to covary with pronouns beyond their c-command domains. In the present paper, I explore a different take. I propose that anaphora is governed not by DPs and their properties; it is governed by predicates (i.e., in the unary case, objects of type {$<$}e, t{$>$}) and their properties. To use a metaphor from dynamic semantics: discourse referents can only be ‘activated’ by predicates, never by DPs (Dynamic Predication Principle). This conceptually simple assumption is shown to have far-reaching consequences. For one, it yields a new take on weak crossover, arguably worthy of consideration. Moreover, it leads to a further general “restatement of the anaphora question”, in Reinhart’s (Linguist Philos 6: 47–88, 1983) words.},

It is proposed that languages may vary in what they let their NPs denote. In some languages (like Chinese), NPs are argumental (names of kinds) and can thus occur freely without determiner in argument position; in others they are predicates (Romance), and this prevents NPs from occurring as arguments, unless the category D(eterminer) is projected. Finally, there are languages (like Germanic or Slavic) which allow both predicative and argumental NPs; these languages, being the ‘union’ of the previous two types, are expected to behave like Romance for certain aspects of their nominal system (the singular count portion) and like Chinese for others (the mass and plural portions). This hypothesis (the ‘Nominal Mapping Parameter’) is investigated not just through typological considerations, but also through a detailed contrastive analysis of bare arguments in Germanic (English) vs. Romance (Italian). Some general consequences of this view, which posits a limited variation in the mapping from syntax into semantics, for current theories of Universal Grammar and acquisition are considered.},

  abstract = {The interpretation of language is a complex phenomenon. One of the best established models maintains that language interpretation arises from the interaction of two major components. On the one hand, sentences are assigned truth conditions, which provide a characterization of propositional content and constitute the domain of semantics. On the other hand, use of propositional content (i.e., truth conditions) in concrete communication is governed by pragmatic norms. In speaking, not only do we pay attention to truth conditional content, we also aim at being cooperative and at saying something relevant to the situation. One way to study this intricate interplay between semantics and pragmatics is by looking at the way adults and children interpret logical words, for example, connectives and quantifiers. In particular, we would like to concentrate on Scalar Implicatures, inferences that we draw when we interpret sentences including certain logical words and that allow one to go beyond what is literally said in the sentence. For example, following Grice and much literature inspired by him, it can be argued that if a speaker says ‘Some students passed the exam’ the hearer is likely to assume that the speaker intended to convey that ‘Some students passed the exam, but not all did’. The addition of ‘but not all did’ is not, however, part of the truth conditions, but an implicature that arises from the way we use language.},

The chapter claims that indefinites in all languages denote existential terms and activate a grammatically determined set of alternatives, factored into meaning through a process of ‘exhaustification’, responsible for the scalar and ‘free choice’ readings of ordinary indefinites (OIs). EIs are viewed in the same way, the only difference from OIs being that EIs’ alternatives cannot be ‘pruned’ (i.e. ‘ignored’) depending on the context. Therefore, with EIs, epistemic effects come about obligatorily. The differences within types of EIs (including Chinese wh’s) are part of (a small set of) parametric differences on how alternatives can be factored in.},

By showing that the non-widening root wh- can successfully form a PSI in Korean, I analyze how the particles -na ‘or’ and -lato ‘even’ that amwu- and wh- combine with function as the two independent sources for free choiceness. I build on Dayal’s (1997) and von Fintel’s (2000) accounts of -ever free relatives for the semantic of -na ‘or,’ and my analysis of -lato ‘even’ extends the scope theory of even items in Guerzoni (2003, 2005). It will be shown that both of the particles commonly yield, directly or indirectly, a “Domain Not-Narrowing” or “No singling out” effect (Jayez and Tovena 2005) as an inference. This inference that reads as “no matter wh-,” triggered by the two particles, forms the common core of free choice (FC) in Korean. Finally, I discuss the contrastive properties of the two types of Korean FC items in terms of their quantificational force and the orientation of FC effects (external locus vs. agent), while as for their common property, I point out that their FC-ness is never cancelable.},

  abstract = {The conjunction fallacy is the well-documented empirical finding that subjects sometimes rate a conjunction A\&amp;B as more probable than one of its conjuncts, A. Most explanations appeal in some way to the fact that B has a high probability. But Tentori et al. (2013) have recently challenged such approaches, reporting experiments which find that (1) when B is confirmed by relevant evidence despite having low probability, the fallacy is common, and (2) when B has a high probability but has not been confirmed by relevant evidence, the fallacy is less common. They conclude that degree of confirmation, rather than probability, is the central determinant of the conjunction fallacy. In this paper, we address a confound in these experiments: Tentori et al. (2013) failed to control for the fact that their (1)-situations make B conversationally relevant, while their (2)-situations do not. Hence their results are consistent with the hypothesis that conversationally relevant high probability is an important driver of the conjunction fallacy. Inspired by recent theoretical work that appeals to conversational relevance to explain the conjunction fallacy, we report on two experiments that control for this issue by making B relevant without changing its degree of probability or confirmation. We find that doing so increases the rate of the fallacy in (2)-situations, and leads to comparable fallacy-rates as (1)-situations. This suggests that (non-probabilistic) conversational relevance indeed plays a role in the conjunction fallacy, and paves the way toward further work on the interplay between relevance and confirmation.},

I propose that Korean deontic modal expressions do not set up the domain of quantification in which the prejacent is evaluated. Instead, they assess the goodness of the prejacent and its alternatives, all else being equal. I allude to the possibility that English obligation also involves similar reasoning by offering a counterfactual-based account of the Professor Procrastinate puzzle. On the other hand, Korean permission gives rise to a specific interpretation of strong permission, conveying that the truth or falsity of the prejacent does not affect the deontic status. I additionally point out that Korean has a separate copula-based construction for expressing modal possibility, which hints that there are in fact two types of permission in natural language.},

This allows for a more fine-grained view on meaning, which has led to improved analyses of a wide range of linguistic phenomena. However, this approach also faces a number of problems. We focus here on two of these, in our view the most fundamental ones. The first has to do with how meanings are composed, i.e., with the type-theoretic operations of function application and abstraction; the second has to do with how meanings are compared, i.e., the notion of entailment. Our aim is to reconcile what we take to be the essence of Hamblin’s proposal with the more orthodox type-theoretic framework rooted in the work of Montague in such a way that both the explanatory utility of the former and the solid formal foundations of the latter are preserved. Our proposal builds on insights from recent work on inquisitive semantics, and it also contributes to the further development of this framework by specifying how the inquisitive meaning of a sentence may be built up compositionally.},

First, we show that two truth-conditionally equivalent clauses can make different semantic contributions when embedded in a counterfactual antecedent. Assuming compositionality, this means that the meaning of these clauses is not fully determined by their truth conditions. This finding has a clear explanation in inquisitive semantics: truth-conditionally equivalent clauses may be associated with different propositional alternatives, each of which counts as a separate counterfactual assumption. Second, we show that our results contradict the common idea that the interpretation of a counterfactual involves minimizing change with respect to the actual state of affairs. We propose to replace the idea of minimal change by a distinction between foreground and background for a given counterfactual assumption: the background is held fixed in the counterfactual situation, while the foreground can be varied without any minimality constraint.},

The latencies in these tasks were consistent with the thesis that: (1) sentences are represented in terms of elementary propositions; (2) pictures are encoded in the same interpretive format; (3) these two codes are compared in an algorithmic series of mental operations, each of which contributes additively to the response latency; and (4) sentence encoding, picture encoding, comparing, and responding are four serially ordered stages, and their component latencies are additive. From these results, it was also possible to rule out certain explanations based on visual imagery, conversion (e.g., converting isn't above into is below), reading time, normative word frequencies, and other factors. Finally, it was shown that this theory is consistent with previous studies on sentence comprehension, sentence verification, concept verification, and other related phenomena.},

These models are generally defined over complete utterances. However, there is substantial evidence that pragmatic reasoning takes place incrementally during production and comprehension. We address this with an incremental IR model. We compare the incremental and global versions using computational simulations, and we assess the incremental model against existing experimental data and in the TUNA corpus for referring expression generation, showing that the model can capture phenomena out of reach of global versions.},

  abstract = {Natural languages contain systematic relationships between verb meaning and verb argument structure. Artificial language learning studies typically remove those relationships and instead pair verb meanings randomly with structures. Adult participants in such studies can detect statistical regularities associated with words in these languages and their use of novel words will adhere to those statistical regularities. However, word use in natural languages is associated with more than distributional statistics. Using an artificial language learning paradigm, we asked how a relationship between verb meaning and sentence structure affected learning and structure generalization. Twenty-four English-speaking adults watched videos described in an artificial language with two possible sentence structures. Half of the participants (statistics-only condition) learned a language with no relationship between verb meaning and sentence structure. The other half (semantics condition) learned a language in which verb meaning predicted which structures a verb occurred in. Although all learners were able to comprehend the learned structures with novel verbs, participants in the semantics conditions made grammaticality judgments and productions with novel verbs that were more consistent with the target language than participants in the statistics-only condition. The availability of semantic cues to verb subcategory supports artificial language learning.},

Overall, de was omitted more than 40\% of the time with a predicative adjective, a significantly higher rate than that found in previous studies. The data reveal a number of factors that may all play a role in determining the likelihood of de omission or retention: the time dependency of the adjective, the particular intensifier chosen to modify the adjective, the discourse function of the utterance and the presence of certain markers of epistemic modality. The findings also lend support to the hypothesis that shi is grammaticalizing to a bound morpheme in some so-called ‘conventionalised forms’ involving epistemic and evidentiality markers.},

  abstract = {Distributional approaches (DAs) to modelling meaning in use are getting more and more attention. Inspired by the distributional hypothesis of Harris (1954), they represent the meaning of a word using a vector consisting of the relative occurrence of this word with respect to other words occurring in its vicinity. Representing the meaning of a word using a vector facilitates the assessment of the similarity of meanings between words. If the distance between two word-vectors is small, then these words have similar meanings, which is to say that they occur in a given corpus with similar surrounding words at similar frequencies. One advantage of DAs is that they take some types of contextual clues into account while simultaneously lending themselves to computational implementations (Landauer et~al. 1998; Lenci 2008). Distributional models of meaning were first developed to deal with word-vectors (Lenci 2018), but some expanded their scope so that they could represent a sentence-vector by combining word-vectors (Clark 2015). However, such measures of word similarity do not transfer easily to notions of sentence similarity, especially when we consider the various kinds of implicatures: compositional DAs completely omit the treatment of the implicated meaning. Nowadays, sentence similarity measures have many applications like paraphrase detection and short answer tasks (Koleva et~al. 2014), automatic summarization (Erkan \& Radev 2004), and machine translation (Liu \& Zong 2004) and it is important to make sure sentence similarity measures take into account the full meaning conveyed by a sentence. This, as I~claim in this chapter, will only be possible if both the explicit and the implicated meaning of a sentence are considered.},

Drawing on data from English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Armenian, Korean, and Persian, the chapter argues that the differences among these languages can be reduced to a small number of differences in a) which features the language makes use of, b) which of those features can project as syntactic heads, and c) the status of non-projecting features as modifiers or head features. Under the proposed analysis, it is not necessary that a language be characterizable, as a whole, as a classifier language or as a plural-marking language. Rather, classifiers and plural marking may coexist in a language as long as only one appears in any given nominal.},

  abstract = {Child and adult speakers of English have different ideas of what `or' means in ordinary statements of the form `A or B'. Even more far-reaching differences between children and adults are found in other languages. This tells us that young children do not learn what `or' means by watching how adults use `or'. An alternative is to suppose that children draw upon a priori knowledge of the meaning of `or'. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that all languages adopt the same meaning of `or' in certain structures. For example, statements of the form `not S[A or B]' have the same meanings in all languages, and disjunctive statements receive a uniform interpretation in sentences that contain certain focus expressions, such as English `only'. These observations are relevant for the long-standing “nature versus nurture” controversy. A linguistic property that (a) emerges in child language without decisive evidence from experience, and (b) is common to all human languages, is a likely candidate for innate specification. Experience matters, of course. As child speakers grow up, they eventually learn to use `or' in the same way as adults do. But, based on findings from child language and cross-linguistic research, it looks like certain aspects of language, including the interpretation of disjunction, are part of the human genome.},

  abstract = {During communication, the interpretation of utterances is sensitive to a listener's probabilistic prior beliefs, something which is captured by one currently influential model of pragmatics, the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework. In this paper we focus on cases when this sensitivity to priors leads to counterintuitive predictions of the framework. Our domain of interest is exhaustivity effects, whereby a sentence such as "Mary came" is understood to mean that only Mary came. We show that in the baseline RSA model, under certain conditions, anti-exhaustive readings are predicted (e.g., "Mary came" would be used to convey that both Mary and Peter came). The specific question we ask is the following: should exhaustive interpretations be derived as purely pragmatic inferences (as in the classical Gricean view, endorsed in the baseline RSA model), or should they rather be generated by an encapsulated semantic mechanism (as argued in some of the recent formal literature)? To answer this question, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of different RSA models and evaluate them against data obtained in a new study which tested the effects of prior beliefs on both production and comprehension, improving on previous empirical work.

The best models turn out to be those which include an encapsulated exhaustivity mechanism (as other studies concluded on the basis of very different data).

  abstract = {During communication, the interpretation of utterances is sensitive to a listener's probabilistic prior beliefs. In this paper, we focus on the influence of prior beliefs on so-called exhaustivity interpretations, whereby a sentence such as Mary came is understood to mean that only Mary came. Two theoretical origins for exhaustivity effects have been proposed in the previous literature. On the one hand are perspectives that view these inferences as the result of a purely pragmatic process (as in the classical Gricean view, and more recent Bayesian approaches); on the other hand are proposals that treat them as the result of an encapsulated semantic mechanism (Chierchia, Fox \& Spector 2012). We gain traction on adjudicating between these two approaches with new theoretical and experimental evidence, focusing on the behavior of different models for exhaustivity effects, all of which fit under the Rational Speech Act modeling framework (RSA, Frank \& Goodman, 2012). Some (but not all!) of these models include an encapsulated semantic mechanism. Theoretically, we demonstrate that many RSA models predict not only exhaustivity, but also anti-exhaustivity, whereby “Mary came” would convey that Mary and someone else came. We evaluate these models against data obtained in a new study which tested the effects of prior beliefs on both production and comprehension, improving on previous empirical work. We find that the models which have the best fit to human behavior include an encapsulated exhaustivity mechanism. We conclude that, on the one hand, in the division of labor between semantics and pragmatics, semantics plays a larger role than is often thought, but, on the other hand, the tradeoff between informativity and cost which characterizes all RSA models does play a central role for genuine pragmatic effects.},

  abstract = {Questions embedded under responsive predicates and definite descriptions both give rise to a variety of phenomena which can be grouped under the term plurality effects: quantificational variability, cumulativity, and homogeneity effects. This similarity has not gone unnoticed, and many proposals have taken inspiration in theories of definite plurals to account for these effects with embedded questions (Dayal in Locality in WH quantification: questions and relative clauses in Hindi, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1996; Lahiri in Questions and answers in embedded contexts, Oxford studies in theoretical linguistics 2, Oxford University Press, New York, 2002; a.o.). Recently these phenomena have received less attention, as the field has focused on the so-called intermediate exhaustive reading of embedded questions instead, after Spector (Exhaustive interpretations: what to say and what not to say, Presentation at LSA Workshop: ‘Context and Content’, 2005) called into question the traditional dichotomy between weak and strong exhaustive readings. As a result, the intermediate exhaustive reading has been accounted for at the expense of empirical coverage in other areas. In this paper, I propose a modular theory which derives the currently much discussed exhaustive readings without giving up the rich semantics necessary to account for plurality effects. My account of quantificational variability, cumulativity, and homogeneity effects builds on recent work on these phenomena in the nominal domain by adopting a categorial approach to embedded questions, while the strong and intermediate exhaustive readings are implemented using an independent strengthening mechanism suggested in Klinedinst and Rothschild (Semant Pragmat 4(2):1–23, 2011). The resulting theory not only recovers important results on plurality effects; it offers new, simple solutions for some puzzles presented in George (Question embedding and the semantics of answers, Ph.D. dissertation, UCLA, 2011; Thought J Philos 2(2):166–177, 2013) and Paillé and Schwarz (in: Stockwell (ed) Proceedings of WCCFL 36, vol 36, Cascadilla Proceedings Project, Somerville, 2018), naturally derives readings that had been postulated in previous literature (Preuss in Issues in the semantics of questions with quantifiers, Ph.D. dissertation, Rutgers University, 2001), makes correct predictions in many unexplored cases, and is compatible with recent results in psycholinguistics. In the last sections I justify my assumptions and show how possible limitations I inherit from the theories I build on can be accommodated under standard assumptions.},

This holds, however, only if the equative occurs without a multiplicative degree modifier. We show how these facts can be captured on relatively simple assumptions about the make-up of equative constructions. Building on the insights of von Stechow (1984) and Rullmann (1995) about the distribution of downward-entailing operators in degree constructions, we argue that the behavior of equatives in Slovenian provides new support for the following two conclusions: (i) that maximality, although a component of equatives, is separable from the other ingredients of the construction (in line with Heim 2006, pace von Stechow 1984; Schwarzschild and Wilkinson 2002, and others) and (ii) that degree domains are always dense (the Universal Density of Measurement, Fox and Hackl 2006).},

We show that it is explained on the assumption that even can move at LF (e.g., Karttunen and Peters, in: Oh CK, Dinneen DA (eds.) Syntax and semantics, 1979). The analysis is subsequently extended to occurrences of negative polarity items (NPIs) in these environments, which mirror the abovementioned distribution of even and which invalidate standard characterizations of NPI licensing conditions in terms of downward-entailingness. The idea behind the extension is that NPIs denote weak elements that are associates of covert even (e.g., Lee and Horn, Any as indefinite + even, 1994).

One approach to this challenge has been to, first, take any-DPs to be subject to an environment-based downward-entailingness condition—they have to occur in an environment that is Strawson downward-entailing with respect to their domain (cf.~Kadmon and Landman 1993)—and, second, to derive such an environment in existential modal sentences by means of exhaustification (e.g.,~Fox 2007). This note presents new evidence for such a two-layered approach (cf.~Crnič 2017, 2019). The evidence comes from a striking contrast in the behavior of singular vs.~plural any-DPs in existential modal sentences. The paper concludes by charting some relations between any-DPs and other polarity items.},

These inferences are standardly derived as an entailment of the meaning of the sentence together with the scalar implicature that it is not the case that either disjunct holds of every individual in the domain of the quantifier, \$\$\{\textbackslash neg\}\$\$Every A is P \& \$\$\{\textbackslash neg\}\$\$Every A is Q (plain negated inferences). As we show, this derivation faces a challenge in that distributive inferences may obtain in the absence of plain negated inferences. We address this challenge by showing that on particular assumptions about alternatives, a derivation of distributive inferences as scalar implicatures can be maintained without in fact necessitating plain negated inferences. These assumptions accord naturally with the grammatical approach to scalar implicatures. We also present experimental data that suggest that plain negated inferences are not only unnecessary for deriving distributive inferences, but might in fact be unavailable.},

  abstract = {The primary theoretical focus of this paper is on Free Choice uses of any, in particular on two phenomena that have remained largely unstudied. One involves the ability of any phrases to occur in affirmative episodic statements when aided by suitable noun modifiers. The other involves the difference between modals of necessity and possibility with respect to licensing of any. The central thesis advanced here is that FC any is a universal determiner whose domain of quantification is not a set of particular individuals but the set of possible individuals of the relevant kind. In a theory of genericity utilizing situations, an any phrase can be seen as having a universal quantifier binding the situation variable of the common noun. This inherent genericity is argued to be at the heart of the intuition that any statements support counterfactual inferences and do not involve existential commitments. A conflict in presuppositions is shown to account for the incompatibility of unmodified any phrases in affirmative episodic statements and the crucial role played by modification in ameliorating this clash is explicated. In the case of modals of necessity, the interaction between the universal force of any and the particular modal base is shown to be crucial. In view of these facts it is argued that FC any is not directly licensed by modal or generic operators as generally assumed but that its felicitous use is sensitive to the pragmatics of epistemic modality. Turning to its polarity sensitive uses, language internal as well as crosslinguistic evidence is presented to distinguish it from FC any in having the existential quantificational force typical of indefinites. The paper concludes by suggesting that the common tie between them is that they both occur in statements that apply to a class of entities, rather than to particular members of the class.},

And three, perhaps less discussed than the other two, what is the relation between identity and free choice (FC) readings of FRs with "ever"? It claims that FRs are always definite. "Ever" introduces a type of modality that is independent of the verbal system by enforcing universal quantification over epistemic alternatives to the world of evaluation. In so doing, it endows the FR with properties typically associated with universal quantifiers. There is no formal distinction between identity and FC readings of FRs. The crucial distinctions have to do with the interaction of uniqueness requirements typical of definites, NP-internal modality and episodic vs. non-episodic interpretations determined by tense and aspect.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that Hindi incorporation is, in fact, pseudo-incorporation, involving noun phrases rather than nouns. Furthermore, it shows that there is no requirement that the incorporated nominal surface as a morphological or even a syntactic unit with the verb. Such loosely aligned nominals can nevertheless be identified as incorporation on the basis of semantic intuitions having to do with number interpretation, anaphora, and certain properties typically associated with lexical processes. Contrary to standard assumptions, it is argued that the target of pseudo-incorporation is specified for number. Singular incorporated nominals in Hindi are shown to be semantically singular, with number neutrality arising as a consequence of interaction with aspectual operators. Taking aspectual information into account is also shown to have interesting implications for current approaches to the semantics of incorporation, one in which the incorporated nominal introduces a discourse referent, and one in which it functions as a predicate modifier. A closer look at the effect of aspect on anaphora, for example, does not unequivocally support the predicate modification view of pseudo-incorporation. The paper draws on data from Hungarian, and to some extent Danish, to explore the cross-linguistic applicability of the claims made on the basis of Hindi. Most notably, a distinction between Hungarian verbs with respect to incorporation of bare singulars provides striking confirmation of the claim that number morphology is semantically visible in pseudo-incorporation. It also addresses restrictions on the productivity of pseudo-incorporation in light of the proposed analysis of pseudo-incorporation.},

He further proposes that their distribution is regulated by a principle called Index!. In this article, we first point out some problems with the empirical generalizations presented in Jenks’s description of Mandarin and then sketch an alternative approach to the distinction between Mandarin demonstratives and bare nouns. We end with some comments about the kind of further empirical work that needs to be done before definitive claims can be made about the competition between demonstratives and other types of definites.},

This book synthesizes and integrates 40 years of research on the semantics of questions, and its interface with pragmatics and syntax. The topics covered are extensive and varied: direct–indirect questions, weak–strong exhaustiveness, maximality, mention-some answers, functional answers, single-multiple-trapped list answers, higher order questions, embedding predicates, selection, quantificational variability, concealed questions, weak islands, pied piping, focus, intervention, polar and alternative questions, bias, negative polarity, non-canonical questions. The literature on this rich set of topics, theoretically diverse and scattered across multiple venues, is often hard to assimilate. The author, drawing on her own research, brings them together for the first time in a coherent, concise, and well-structured whole. Readers will find in this book a lucid exposition of the classics as well as discussion of the most recent, cutting edge research on questions. Each chapter begins with a non-technical introduction to the issues. Semantically sophisticated accounts are presented incrementally and major points summarized at the end of each section. Individual accounts of phenomena are placed in the relevant context. Issues that remain open are highlighted and promising lines of further inquiry sketched out. It constitutes at the same time a comprehensible guide to one of the most vibrant areas of research in natural language semantics and a compass for how this area of study is developing.},

It argues that any is a universal, though its universality is such that it can be conjoined with an existential statement. This is established by showing, first of all, that various properties that are amenable to a universal account of FC any remain elusive in recent accounts that treat it as an indefinite. Secondly, it presents a detailed description of supplementary/numeral any, cases in which any occurs with an indefinite. Such cases have been assumed to provide evidence for the indefinite-any view but an explicit semantics for the constructions is given, showing that any invariably contributes universal quantificational force. Existential force always comes from other elements. The paper also discusses alternative formulations that preserve the key insights of the universalist position and the role of cross-linguistic variation in the study of FC items.},

This is known as an ignorance inference. We can distinguish between two aspects of this inference: the negated universal upper bound part (i.e., the speaker is uncertain about each disjunct), which we call uncertainty, and the existential lower bound part (i.e., the speaker considers each disjunct possible), which we call possibility. In the traditional approach, uncertainty is derived as a primary implicature, from which possibility follows. In this paper, we report on two experiments using a sentence-picture verification task based on the mystery box paradigm that challenge the traditional implicature approach. Our findings show that possibility can arise without uncertainty, and we thus call for a reevaluation of the traditional view of disjunction and ignorance inferences. Our experimental findings are related to similar results involving disjunction in embedded contexts and pave the way for alternative theories that can account for the observed patterns of inference derivation in a unified fashion. We discuss how recent implicature and non-implicature theories can account for the derivation of existential lower bound inferences without the presence of negated universal upper bound inferences.},

In this review, I demonstrate the basic mechanics and commitments of RSA as well as some of its standard extensions, highlighting the key features that have led to its success in accounting for a wide variety of pragmatic phenomena. Fundamentally, it treats language as probabilistic, informativeness as gradient, alternatives as context-dependent, and subjective prior beliefs (world knowledge) as a crucial facet of interpretation.

Notoriously, interpreting the sentence ‘You can speak to Bill or John’ with the meaning that you are free to speak to either of them involves a logical entailment that cannot be derived by any current version of Standard Deontic Logic: ⋄(p∨q)~→~⋄p∧⋄q. We argue that the FC reading is the result of a non-Gricean process of pragmatic intrusion that slightly affects the interpretation of propositional operators to ensure that two distinct scope assignments be associated with distinct truth conditions. We further show that the attempt to derive the FC reading from an enriched version of scalar implicature computation (based on Grice’s Maxim of Quantity) meets important empirical and theoretical objections, besides not being confirmed by some relevant experimental results in language processing and language acquisition. We propose that the key to FC computation is local compositional semantics and, more particularly, the availability, within the same sentence, of two competing construals of relative scope assignment.},

  abstract = {Sentences such as Olivia can take Logic or Algebra (‘♢∨-sentences’) are typically interpreted as entailing that Olivia can take Logic and can take Algebra. Given a standard semantics for modals and disjunction, those ‘Free choice’ (FC) readings are not predicted from the surface form of ♢∨-sentences. Yet the standard semantics is appropriate for the ‘double prohibition’ reading typically assigned to ¬♢∨-sentences like Olivia can’t take Logic or Algebra. Several extant approaches to FC can account for those two cases, but face challenges when ♢∨, ¬♢∨ and related sentences appear embedded in certain environments. In this paper, we present a novel account of FC that builds on a ‘grammatical’ theory of scalar implicatures — proposed by Bassi et al. (2021) and Del Pinal (2021) — according to which covert exhaustification is a presupposition trigger such that the prejacent forms the assertive content while any excludable or includable alternatives are incorporated at the non-at issue, presuppositional level. Applied to ♢∨, ¬♢∨, and similar sentences, ‘presuppositional exhaustification’ predicts that their default interpretations have an assertive component (roughly, the classical interpretation of the prejacent) and a homogeneity presupposition which projects in standard ways. Those predictions, we then show, support a uniform account of the puzzling behavior of ♢∨, ¬♢∨, and related sentences when embedded under (negative) factives (Marty \&amp; Romoli 2020), disjunctions (Romoli \&amp; Santorio 2019), and in the scope of universal, existential (Bar-Lev \&amp; Fox 2020) and non-monotonic quantifiers (Gotzner et al. 2020).

  abstract = {According to the ‘grammatical account’, scalar implicatures are triggered by a covert exhaustification operator present in logical form. This account covers considerable empirical ground, but there is a peculiar pattern that resists treatment given its usual implementation. The pattern centers on odd assertions like \#Most lions are mammals and \#Some Italians come from a beautiful country, which seem to trigger implicatures in contexts where the enriched readings conflict with information in the common ground. Magri (Nat Language Semant 17(3):245–297. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11050-009-9042-x, 2009; Semant Pragmat 4(6):1–51. https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.4.6, 2011) argues that, to account for these cases, the basic grammatical approach has to be supplemented with the stipulations that exhaustification is obligatory and is based on formal computations which are blind to information in the common ground. In this paper, I argue that accounts of oddness should allow for the possibility of felicitous assertions that call for revision of the common ground, including explicit assertions of unusual beliefs such as Most but not all lions are mammals and Some but not all Italians come from Italy. To adequately cover these and similar cases, I propose that Magri’s version of the Grammatical account should be refined with the novel hypothesis that exhaustification triggers a bifurcation between presupposed (the negated relevant alternatives) and at-issue (the prejacent) content. The explanation of the full oddness pattern, including cases of felicitous proposals to revise the common ground, follows from the interaction between presupposed and at-issue content with an independently motivated constraint on accommodation. Finally, I argue that treating the exhaustification operator as a presupposition trigger helps solve various independent puzzles faced by extant grammatical accounts, and motivates a substantial revision of standard accounts of the overt exhaustifier only.},

The extent to which different readings are accessible depends on the quantifier, but how to model this dependence is debated (Kanazawa, 1994; Champollion et al. 2019). This study advances this debate by providing novel experimental data on the interpretation of donkey anaphora in sentences with non-monotonic quantifiers exactly 3 and all but one. We establish that while the existential reading of donkey anaphora is the preferred one with both exactly 3 and all but one, the universal reading is accessed more with all but one than with exactly 3. These results have important implications for both Kanazawa (1994) and Champollion et al. (2019) theories, as both need to be amended to fully capture the empirical picture.},

We show that the inferential judgments reported for a given environment are modified in the presence of polarity items.

For example, the licensing of the NPI any in the sentence *Monkey didn’t give every lion any chocolate is disrupted by intervention. Interveners also happen to be items that trigger scalar implicatures in environments in which NPIs are licensed (Chierchia 2004; 2013). A natural hypothesis, initially proposed in Chierchia (2004), is that there is a link between the two phenomena. In this paper, we investigate whether intervention effects arise when scalar implicatures are derived.},

At the same time, we need a lexical theory of distributivity to account for the various distributive interpretations that we do find with groups; a formalisation of such a theory is outlined in the final section of this paper.},

It may also license a stronger inference: that the speaker believes that not all students are home (Secondary Scalar Implicature). Using an experimental paradigm which allows to distinguish between these three distinct readings as such (literal reading, primary SI, secondary SI), we show that the secondary SI can be accessed even in contexts where the speaker is not presented as being well-informed, a result which goes against classical neo-Gricean pragmatic approaches to Scalar Implicature, but is compatible with both the ‘grammatical’ approach to Scalar Implicatures and some more recent game-theoretic pragmatic models in which speakers and listeners engage in sophisticated higher-order reasoning about each other. Second, we use this paradigm to compare standard scalar items such as some and expressions whose interpretation has been argued to involve SIs, but controversially: almost, numerals and plural morphology. For some and almost, we find that speakers do access three distinct readings, but for numerals and plural morphology, only the literal reading and the secondary implicature could be detected, and no primary implicature, which suggests that the pragmatic and semantic mechanisms at play are different for both types of items.},

  abstract = {This study shows that the Turkish expression hani exhibits interesting properties for the study of the semantics and pragmatics interface, because, on the one hand, its function is merely pragmatic, but on the other hand, it is subject to the truth-conditional effect of other constituents at LF. This notwithstanding, studies on this expression are remarkably scarce. The only attempts to describe its properties are Erguvanlı-Taylan (Studies on Turkish and Turkic languages; proceedings of the ninth international conference on Turkish linguistics, 133–143, 2000), Akar et~al. (Discourse meaning, 57–78, 2020), and Akar and Öztürk (Information-structural perspectives on discourse particles, 251–276, 2020). In the present study, we introduce the first formal semantic and pragmatic treatment of clauses containing hani. Unlike previous accounts, we claim that hani can have one of the following two major pragmatic functions: making salient a proposition in the Common Ground or challenging one in a past Common Ground, therefore requiring a Common Ground revision. Despite its variety of occurrences, we argue that hani has a uniform interpretation and provide a compositional analysis of the different construals that it is associated with. Furthermore, we show that a formally explicit and accurate characterization of hani clauses requires operating on indexical parameters, in particular the context time. Therefore, if our proposal is on the right track, hani clauses may provide indirect empirical evidence in favour of the existence of “monstrous” phenomena, adding to the accumulating cross-linguistic evidence in this domain (see Schlenker in Linguistics and Philosophy 26(1):29–120, 2003 and much work since then). The definition of monsters is intended as in Kaplan (Themes from Kaplan, 481–563, 1989).},

We rely on a diagnostic first proposed by Orin Percus (1998) and Irene Heim (2015), which uses redundancy to probe for the pragmatic asymmetry between presupposed and asserted content in the global case. We provide novel data that show that even in the case of local accommodation, redundancy is sensitive to the difference between the two types of content. We argue that our data pose a problem for the A-operator theory of local accommodation, while being compatible with dynamic approaches (Heim, 1982) and a more recent domain restriction approach (von Fintel, 2004; Chatain and Schlenker, 2023).},

  abstract = {In the course of proving a tenability result about the probabilities of conditionals, van Fraassen (1976) introduced a semantics for conditionals based on omega-sequences of worlds, which amounts to a particularly simple special case of ordering semantics for conditionals. On that semantics, 'If p, then q' is true at an omega-sequence just in case q is true at the first tail of the sequence where p is true (if such a tail exists). This approach has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, its logic has never been explored. We axiomatize the logic of omega-sequence semantics, showing that it is the result of adding two new axioms to Stalnaker's logic C2: one, Flattening, which is prima facie attractive, and, and a second, Sequentiality, which is complex and difficult to assess, but, we argue, likely invalid. But we also show that when sequence semantics is generalized from omega-sequences to arbitrary (transfinite) ordinal sequences, the result is a more attractive logic that adds only Flattening to C2. We also explore the logics of a few other interesting restrictions of ordinal sequence semantics. Finally, we address the question of whether sequence semantics is motivated by probabilistic considerations, answering, pace van Fraassen, in the negative.},

After spelling out our theory, we use it to argue that guessing plays a central role in our cognitive lives. In particular, our account of guessing yields new theories of belief, assertion, and the conjunction fallacy—the psychological finding that people sometimes rank a conjunction as more probable than one of its conjuncts. More generally, we suggest that guessing helps explain how boundedly rational agents like us navigate a complex, uncertain world.},

The offline study showed that a violation of exhaustivity with only is less acceptable than the violation with it-clefts, suggesting a difference in the nature of exhaustivity interpretation in the two environments. The ERP-results confirm that this difference can be seen in online processing as well: a violation of exhaustiveness in only-foci elicited a centro-posterior positivity (600–800ms), whereas a violation in it-clefts induced a globally distributed N400 pattern (400–600ms). The positivity can be interpreted as a reanalysis process and more generally as a process of context updating. The N400 effect in it-clefts is interpreted as indexing a cancelation process that is functionally distinct from the only case. The ERP study is, to our knowledge, the first evidence from an online experimental paradigm which shows that the violation of exhaustiveness involves different underlying processes in the two structural environments.},

On their approach, a conditional takes the value of its consequent whenever its antecedent is true, and the value Indeterminate otherwise. Here we deal with the problem of selecting an adequate notion of validity for this conditional. We show that all standard validity schemes based on de Finetti’s table come with some problems, and highlight two ways out of the predicament: one pairs de Finetti’s conditional (DF) with validity as the preservation of non-false values (TT-validity), but at the expense of Modus Ponens; the other modifies de Finetti’s table to restore Modus Ponens. In Part I of this paper, we present both alternatives, with specific attention to a variant of de Finetti’s table (CC) proposed by Cooper (Inquiry 11, 295–320, 1968) and Cantwell (Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 49, 245–260, 2008). In Part II, we give an in-depth treatment of the proof theory of the resulting logics, DF/TT and CC/TT: both are connexive logics, but with significantly different algebraic properties.},

We argue that in contexts in which a cooperative speaker is not perfectly informed about the world, the use of vague expressions can offer an optimal tradeoff between truthfulness (Gricean Quality) and informativeness (Gricean Quantity). Focusing on expressions of approximation such as “around”, which are semantically vague, we show that they allow the speaker to convey indirect probabilistic information, in a way that can give the listener a more accurate representation of the information available to the speaker than any more precise expression would (intervals of the form “between”). That is, vague sentences can be more informative than their precise counterparts. We give a probabilistic treatment of the interpretation of “around”, and offer a model for the interpretation and use of “around”-statements within the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework. In our account the shape of the speaker’s distribution matters in ways not predicted by the Lexical Uncertainty model standardly used in the RSA framework for vague predicates. We use our approach to draw further lessons concerning the semantic flexibility of vague expressions and their irreducibility to more precise meanings.},

The present paper examines the hypothesis, originally put forward by Hintikka 1975, that the only verbs that can take both that-complements and whether-complements are the factive verbs. I argue that at least one half of the hypothesis is empirically correct, namely that all veridical attitude verbs taking that-complements take whether-complements. I distinguish veridical verbs from factive verbs, and present one way of deriving the generalization. Counterexamples to both directions of the factivity hypothesis are discussed, in particular the case of emotive factive verbs like regret, and the case of nonveridical verbs that licence whether-complements, in particular tell, guess, decide and agree. Alternative accounts are discussed along the way, in particular Zuber (1982), Ginzburg (1995) and Saebo (2006).},

Intrasentential anaphora proceeds via standard dynamic mechanisms, thus grounding WCO in an independently motivated notion of accessibility. While  conceptually appealing, I show that Chierchia's account is hamstrung by a central design feature of first-generation dynamic theories - the external staticity of negation and related operators. This gives rise to the (I argue, erroneous) prediction that any expression that can outscope negation for the purposes of intersentential anaphora can obviate Weak Crossover. To address this issue, I suggest that we need a dynamic semantics in which operators such as negation selectively destroy indeterminate discourse referents, but leave determinate discourse referents unscathed. I develop a version of monadic dynamic semantics (Charlow 2014, 2019) which accomplishes just this, by tweaking the semantics of indefinites. Perhaps surprisingly, the resulting system is in some respects simpler than first-generation dynamic theories - negation will end up being classical. As an added bonus, the resulting system validates double-negation elimination - a recalcitrant problem for first-generation theories.},

According to the classical FC inference schema, given a sentence of the form ♢(φ ∨ ψ), one can infer ♢φ and ♢ψ. FC with anaphora involves cases where an anaphoric dependency spans φ ∨ ψ. Anaphora is heavily constrained in disjunctions, but a negative existential statement in the initial disjunct can license a pronoun in the latter disjunct — so called bathroom disjunctions, e.g., “Either there’s no bathroom in this house, or it’s in a funny place”. We show that embedding a bathroom disjunction under an existential modal gives rise to a FC inference that doesn’t follow from the classical schema — since the schema is stated in terms of the individual disjuncts, any information about anaphoric dependencies between disjuncts is lost. In order to capture FC with anaphora, we develop a semantic account based on Goldstein 2019, couched in the framework of Bilateral Update Semantics. We also discuss alternative ways of accounting for FC with anaphora, within an exhaustification framework, as well as introducing several related problems involving anaphora and inferences which we characterize as involving simplification more generally.

It’s well known that existential quantification renders upper bounds inert—an issue known as ‘van Benthem’s problem’. This can be addressed by building a notion of maximality into the semantics of modified numerals, but this fails to capture attested cumulative readings due to how maximality takes scope with respect to other operators. Existing work addressing this compositional stalemate exploits powerful mechanisms for side-stepping scopal interactions, such as post-suppositions (Brasoveanu, 2013). Here, I maintain a simple treatment of modified numerals as existential quantifiers over pluralities, while significantly enriching the ontology of pluralities themselves.

Using data from Spanish, Greek, and Hungarian, where simplex wh-expressions inflect for number, we claim that singular simplex wh-expressions do not give rise to a Uniqueness Presupposition, but plural simplex wh-expressions nonetheless give rise to an Anti-Singleton Inference. We provide an analysis of these facts that is consistent with Dayal’s (1996) account of constituent questions, by assigning simplex wh-expressions a type-ambiguous denotation.},

In this fourteen-language study of answers to questions in conversation, we compare the two main strategies; first, interjection-type answers such as uh-huh (or equivalents yes, mm, head nods, etc.), and second, repetition-type answers that repeat some or all of the question. We find that all languages offer both options, but that there is a strong asymmetry in their frequency of use, with a global preference for interjection-type answers. We propose that this preference is motivated by the fact that the two options are not equivalent in meaning. We argue that interjection-type answers are intrinsically suited to be the pragmatically unmarked, and thus more frequent, strategy for confirming polar questions, regardless of the language spoken. Our analysis is based on the semantic-pragmatic profile of the interjection-type and repetition-type answer strategies, in the context of certain asymmetries inherent to the dialogic speech act structure of question–answer sequences, including sequential agency and thematic agency. This allows us to see possible explanations for the outlier distributions found in ǂĀkhoe Haiǁom and Tzeltal.},

  abstract = {“Scalar implicatures” is a phrase used to refer to some inferences arising from the competition between alternatives: typically, “Mary read some of the books” ends up conveying that Mary did not read all books, because one could have said “Mary read all books”. The so-called grammatical theory argues that these inferences obtain from the application of a covert operator \$\$ exh \$\$, which not only has the capability to negate alternative sentences, but also the capability to be embedded within sentences under other linguistic operators, i.e.~\$\$ exh \$\$has the potential to add to the meaning of expressions (not necessarily full sentences), the negation of their alternatives. This view typically seeks support from the existence of readings that could not be explained without the extra-capability of \$\$ exh \$\$to occur in embedded positions. However, if some embedded positions seem to be accessible to \$\$ exh \$\$, not all conceivable positions that \$\$ exh \$\$could occupy yield sensible results. In short: the \$\$ exh \$\$approach is powerful, maybe too powerful. Various approaches based on logical strength and monotonicity have been proposed to justify on principled grounds the limited distribution of \$\$ exh \$\$; these approaches are mostly based on a comparison between possible parses, and considerations of monotonicity (e.g., the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis). We propose a new constraint based instead on “connectedness”, ruling out parses because of inherent problems their outcome may raise. Connectedness is a sister notion of monotonicity, which has been recruited to explain certain lexical restrictions on nouns, adjectives and more recently quantifiers; we propose here that connectedness could play a similar role at the level of propositional meanings.},

The article further shows that these facts do not fall out straightforwardly from existing theories of polar questions, (apparent) coordinations of questions, and presupposition projection. It then proposes a trivalent extension of inquisitive semantics such that the observed pattern can be understood in terms of existing theories of presupposition projection. The proposal has the following properties: (a) apparent coordinations of questions are indeed coordinations of questions, and (b) the semantic denotation of polar questions is asymmetric with respect to the “yes” and “no” answers.},

Third and finally, I show that there are certain reduced clauses where shì is completely disallowed, although other focus particles such as ‘only’ may appear. To explain this last restriction, I propose that reference to a QUD is mediated by a functional head in the clause periphery. Shì is thus unavailable in reduced clauses which do not project this high functional layer.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates the consequences of overt and covert movement on association with focus. The interpretation of focus-sensitive operators such as only and even depends on the presence of a focused constituent in their scope. I document the complex conditions under which operators are able to associate with a focused constituent which has moved out of their scope. In particular, I concentrate on the ability of English even but not only to associate "backwards" in this configuration. I propose a theory based on the Copy Theory of movement which predicts the attested patterns of backwards association. When an operator gives the appearance of associating backwards, it is in fact associating with focus in the lower copy of the movement chain, within its scope. This is possible with even but not only due to independent differences in their compositional semantics: only uses focus alternatives to compute new truth conditions, whereas even uses the alternatives to introduce a presupposition without modifying the truth conditions. I furthermore argue that neither syntactic reconstruction nor covert movement of even (the scope theory) are adequate as a general solution to the problem of backwards association. This analysis supports a view where focus is represented in the narrow syntax and then interpreted at the interfaces. The analysis is built upon a general framework for focus interpretation based on Kratzer (1991) which I apply to structures involving copy chains, combined with new facts regarding the projection behavior of the scalar inference of even. After presenting my proposal, I discuss its implications for the internal structure of DPs and show that it offers a new structural diagnostic for the derivational path of movement. Moreover, the inbty of scope reconstruction to feed focus association in English motivates a new approach to syntactic reconstruction. The proposal developed here explains a range constraints on patterns of focus association, and more generally contributes to our understanding of the interaction of syntactic operations such as movement with the semantic and information-structural notion of focus.},

When hmá takes wide scope, it leads to an exhaustive interpretation which is not scale-sensitive. When hmá takes scope under negation, the resulting expression will have a scale-sensitive felicity condition due to a Non-Vacuity constraint. We show that hma makes reference to alternatives ordered by likelihood, but cannot use other contextual orderings such as rank-orders.We also analyze the sentence-final mood marker ta/da, which frequently but not always appears in scalar hmá utterances, in a manner similar to focus concord effects in other languages. We propose that ta/da is a marker of propositional clefts and argue that the semantics of hmá and the pragmatic requirements of propositional clefts together derive this apparent focus concord effect, as well as its exceptions.

The papers present important new insights into recent semantic and syntactic research on the topic. The volume deals with the following problems in detail: event structure and syntactic construction, event structure and modification, event structure and plurality, event structure and temporal relation, event structure and situation aspect, and event structure and language ontology. Importantly, the topic is discussed not only on the basis of English and German but on the basis of other languages including Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, and Igbo as well. This volume thus provides solid evidence towards clarifying the empirical use of event based analyses.},

Applying the covered-box method (Huang et al. 2013) to scope phenomena, we show that inverse scope is available to some extent in the free constituent order language German, thereby validating earlier findings on other syntactic configurations in German (Radó \&amp; Bott 2018) and empirical claims on other free constituent order languages (Japanese, Russian, Hindi), as well as recent corpus findings in Webelhuth (2020). Moreover, the results of the indirect covered-box experiment replicate findings from an earlier direct-query experiment with comparable target items, in which participants were asked directly about the availability of surface scope and inverse scope readings. The configuration of interest consisted of canonical transitive clauses with deaccented existential subject and universal object QPs, in which the restriction of the universal QP was controlled for by the context.},

We first discuss the discourse components we assume and then define default assertions and default polar questions in a way that allows us to characterize two types of responses to these speech acts, confirming and reversing reactions. The common characteristics of assertions and polar questions are responsible for the fact that both allow these reactions; the differences between the two speech acts explain the different contextual effects confirming and reversing moves have depending on whether they react to an assertion or a polar question. We then examine the distribution of a set of ‘polarity’ particles in Romanian in terms of the notions defined in the rest of the paper and end with a series of predictions concerning polarity particles across languages.},

We review the main challenges such an account has to meet, and develop an analysis which treats the plural morpheme as semantically relevant, and the singular form as not contributing any number restriction on its own but acquiring one when in competition with the plural form. The competition between singular and plural nominals is grounded in bidirectional optimization over form-meaning pairs. The main conceptual advantage our proposal has over recent alternative accounts is that it respects Horn's 'division of pragmatic labor', in that it treats morphologically marked forms as semantically marked, and morphologically unmarked forms as semantically unmarked. In our account, plural forms are polysemous between an exclusive plural sense, which enforces sum reference, and an inclusive sense, which allows both atoms and sums as possible witnesses. The analysis predicts that a plural form is pragmatically appropriate only in case sum values are among the intended referents. To account for the choice between these two senses in context we invoke the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis, an independently motivated pragmatic principle. Finally, we show how the approach we develop explains some puzzling contrasts in number marking between English "three/more children" and Hungarian "három/több gyerek" ('three/more child'), a problem that has not been properly accounted for in the literature so far. doi:10.3765/sp.3.6 BibTeX info},

It can be shown that the most productive Arabic universal kull (and arguably its kins in Semitic and other languages) conveys three universal quantifier senses, roughly equivalent to English all, every, and each (and not only just two, as commonly assumed). Similar trilogies are observed in Greek, French, or Hebrew (with two Q words, or just one). Thanks to their feature and category specifications, universal subtypes are more appropriately characterized in terms of Merge and Move syntactic operations, as in Chomsky (1995), Beghelli and Stowell (1997), and they conform to internal composition of variational quantifier meaning (as in e.g. Szabolcsi 2010, Mathewson 2013), and appealing results about distributivity (Tunstall 1998 \& Champollion 2017, among others).},

To begin with, I examine the arguments that have been given for and against assimilating homogeneity to the phenomenon of vagueness (and contend that none of these arguments, neither the positive nor the negative ones, are conclusive). Next, I present three linguistic tests in which homogeneous and vague sentences come apart very clearly, namely, the disagreement test (§ 3.1), the epistemic test (§ 3.2), and the ‘I’m not sure’ test (§ 3.3). On the basis of these results, I conclude that homogeneity is best understood as a phenomenon of its own and not as a manifestation of vagueness.},

  abstract = {This article demonstrates that the most common prosodic realization of focus can be subsumed typologically under the notion of alignment: a focused constituent is preferably aligned prosodically with the right or left edge of a prosodic domain the size of either a prosodic phrase or an intonation phrase. Languages have different strategies to fulfill alignment, some of which are illustrated in this paper: syntactic movement, cleft constructions, insertion of a prosodic boundary, and enhancement of existing boundaries. Additionally, morpheme insertion and pitch accent plus deaccenting can also be understood as ways of achieving alignment. None of these strategies is obligatory in any language. For a focus to be aligned is just a preference, not a necessary property, and higher-ranked constraints often block the fulfillment of alignment. A stronger focus, like a contrastive one, is more prone to be aligned than a weaker one, like an informational focus. Prominence, which has often been claimed to be the universal prosodic property of focus (see Truckenbrodt 2005 and Büring 2010 among others), may co-occur with alignment, as in the case of a right-aligned nuclear stress, but crucially, alignment is not equivalent to prominence. Rather, alignment is understood as a mean to separate constituents with different information structural roles in different prosodic domains, to ‘package’ them individually.},

When the sentence form was affirmative (i.e., “X is a Y”), false sentences produced scalp potentials that were significantly more negative than those for true sentences, in the region of about 250 to 450 msec following presentation of the sentence object. In contrast, when the sentence form was negative (i.e., “X is not a Y”), it was the true statements that were associated with the ERP negativity. Since both the false-affirmative and the true-negative sentences consist of “mismatched” subject and object terms (e.g., sparrow / vehicle), it was concluded that the negativity in the potentials reflected a semantic mismatch between terms at a preliminary stage of sentence comprehension, rather than the falseness of the sentence taken as a whole. Similarities between the present effects of semantic mismatches and the N400 associated with incongruous sentences (Kutas \& Hillyard, 1980) are discussed. The pattern of response latencies and of ERPs taken together supported a model of sentence comprehension in which negatives are dealt with only after the proposition to be negated is understood.},

  abstract = {We provide an analysis of focus and exhaustive focus in the Grassfields Bantu language Awing. We show that Awing provides an exceptionally clear window into the syntactic properties of exhaustive focus. Our analysis reveals that the Awing particle lə́ (le) realizes a left-peripheral head which, in terms of its syntactic position in the functional sequence, closely corresponds to the Foc(us) head in standard cartographic analyses (e.g., Rizzi 1997). Crucially, however, we show that le is only used if the focus it associates with receives a presuppositional exhaustive (cleft-like) interpretation. Other types of focus are not formally encoded in Awing. In order to reflect this semantic specification of le, we call its syntactic category Exh rather than Foc. Another point of difference from what one would consider a “standard” cartographic Foc head is that the focus associated with le is not realized in its specifier but rather within its complement. More particularly, we argue that le associates with the closest maximal projection it asymmetrically c-commands. The broader theoretical relevance of the present work is at least two-fold. First, our paper offers novel evidence in support of Horvath’s (2010) Strong Modularity Hypothesis for Discourse Features, according to which information structural notions such as focus cannot be represented in narrow syntax as formal features. We argue that the information structure-related movement operations that Awing exhibits can be accounted for by interface considerations, in the spirit of Reinhart (2006). Second, our data support the generality of the so-called closeness requirement on association with focus (Jacobs 1983), which dictates that a focus-sensitive particle be as close to its focus as possible (in terms of c-command). What is of special significance is the fact that Awing exhibits two different avenues to satisfying closeness. The standard one—previously described for German or Vietnamese and witnessed here for the Awing particle tśɔ’ə ‘only’—relies primarily on the flexible attachment of the focus-sensitive particle. The Awing particle le, in contrast, is syntactically rigid. For that reason, the satisfaction of closeness relies solely on the flexibility of other syntactic constituents.},

  abstract = {Assuming Grosu’s (1973) decomposition of Ross’s (1967) Coordinate Structure Constraint into the Conjunct Constraint and the Element Constraint, this article searches for a principled account for the Conjunct Constraint, rebaptized as the Coordinand Constraint. It defends the proposal that different families of effects of the Coordinand Constraint are related to different factors: (a) the lexical information provided by a coordinator, (b) the economy of syntactic displacement operations, and (c) an interface condition prohibiting self-coordination. These three factors are not primitive, but derive from Chomsky’s (1991) Least Effort Principle. Therefore, the Coordinand Constraint is deduced, ultimately, from the Least Effort Principle.},

We argue that in both cases the alternatives are determined in the same way, as a contextual restriction of the focus value of the sentence, which, in turn, is defined in structure-sensitive terms. We provide evidence that contextual restriction is subject to a constraint that prevents it from discriminating between alternatives when they stand in a particular logical relationship with the assertion or the prejacent, a relationship that we refer to as symmetry. Due to this constraint on contextual restriction, discriminating between alternatives in cases of symmetry becomes the task of focus values. This conclusion is incompatible with standard type-theoretic definitions of focus values, motivating our structure-sensitive definition instead.},

In the picture that we had in mind, the syntax is autonomous – ‘‘it does what it does’’ – but sometimes the result maps to an unusable phonological representation. In this sense, linearization acts logically as a filter on derivations. We know of no evidence that the syntax can predict which syntactic objects will be usable by the phonology, and we know of no clear evidence that the phonology communicates this information to the syntax. In this sense, our proposal fits squarely into the tradition that Svenonius characterizes as the ‘‘mainstream’’. We thus attempted to identify certain deviant configurations that are not plausibly excluded for syntax-internal reasons, but are filtered out in the linearization process.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an architecture for the mapping between syntax and phonology – in particular, that aspect of phonology that determines the linear ordering of words. We propose that linearization is restricted in two key ways. (1) the relative ordering of words is fixed at the end of each phase, or ‘‘Spell-out domain’’; and (2) ordering established in an earlier phase may not be revised or contradicted in a later phase. As a consequence, overt extraction out of a phase P may apply only if the result leaves unchanged the precedence relations established in P. We argue first that this architecture (‘‘cyclic linearization’’) gives us a means of understanding the reasons for successive-cyclic movement. We then turn our attention to more specific predictions of the proposal: in particular, the effects of Holmberg’s Generalization on Scandinavian Object Shift; and also the Inverse Holmberg Effects found in Scandinavian ‘‘Quantifier Movement’’ constructions (Rögnvaldsson (1987); Jónsson (1996); Svenonius (2000)) and in Korean scrambling configurations (Ko (2003, 2004)). The cyclic linearization proposal makes predictions that cross-cut the details of particular syntactic configurations. For example, whether an apparent case of verb fronting results from V-to-C movement or from ‘‘remnant movement’’ of a VP whose complements have been removed by other processes, the verb should still be required to precede its complements after fronting if it preceded them before fronting according to an ordering established at an earlier phase. We argue that ‘‘cross-construction’’ consistency of this sort is in fact found.},

  abstract = {In the linguistics literature, the derivation of scalar implicatures has often been handled in a relatively modular way, using computations that are sensitive to logical relations among alternatives such as entailment but are blind to other notions such as the probabilities that participants in a conversation might associate with these alternatives (or with related propositions). In recent years, a family of models that we refer to as iterated rationality models (IRMs) have offered an interestingly different perspective on such alternative-sensitive processes in terms of multiple iterations of (typically probabilistic) reasoning. Our paper investigates what at first sight seems like a very interesting argument for the adequacy of IRMs as models of scalar implicatures, coming from the conjunctive interpretation of disjunctive sentences. We then outline challenges for the argument based on a theoretical comparison with the grammatical theory of scalar implicatures. The comparison focuses on the full distribution of conjunctive interpretation, on the question of sensitivity to priors, and on other results achieved within the grammatical theory that the IRM literature has yet to engage with.},

But the constraint is more restrictive therebyderiving the sensitivity of higher order quantification to negative islands (Spector, 2008).Moreover, when combined with recent proposals about the nature of Exh – designedprimarily to account for the conjunctive interpretation of disjunction (e.g. Bar-Lev and Fox,2017) – Dayal’s presupposition follows only in certain environments.

We measure people’s height, the weight of physical objects, the length of stretches of time, or the size of various collections of individuals. Measurements of height, weight, and the like are commonly thought of as mappings between objects and dense scales, while measurements of collections of individuals, as implemented for instance in counting, are assumed to involve discrete scales. It is also commonly assumed that natural language makes use of both types of scales and subsequently distinguishes between two types of measurements. This paper argues against the latter assumption. It argues that natural language semantics treats all measurements uniformly as mappings from objects (individuals or collections of individuals) to dense scales, hence the Universal Density of Measurement (UDM). If the arguments are successful, there are a variety of consequences for semantics and pragmatics, and more generally for the place of the linguistic system within an overall architecture of cognition.},

We examine the semantics/pragmatics of Italian positive and negative polar questions (building on the literature on biased questions) and propose the first fully compositional analysis of the Italian particle ‘mica’, appearing in negative polar questions and negative assertions. The core is that ‘mica’ is member of a family of presuppositional, epistemic ‘common ground management’ operators, leading to a new account of epistemic inferences in biased polar questions that relies on the presuppositional nature of these operators. We argue that ‘mica’ is a high-left-periphery particle that indicates a presupposed bias against a proposition being added to the common ground, anchored uniformly to the speaker and therefore not showing ‘interrogative flip’. The paper develops connections between common-ground management operators and evidentials, arguing that interrogative flip (and lack thereof) is a phenomenon that should be studied for a wide variety of discourse particles.

The analysis is shown to predict the observed descriptive generalizations about summative existentials, including the highly restricted circumstances that give rise to them. The unorthodox semantics proposed for cardinals is argued to be independently motivated.},

It takes as its starting point a puzzle about expressions like even and its cross linguistic kin in declarative sentences that deny presuppositions: these focus-sensitive scalar additive operators can be used in negative presupposition denials but not in positive ones. This puzzle reveals that i) presuppositions triggered within focus alternatives matter, and ii) even triggers an additive presupposition. The rest of the thesis considers what these findings can teach us about other areas of the grammar. It presents a variety of arguments in defense of even's additive presupposition, which has long been a point of controversy, and shows that even's additivity helps to make sense of some surprising behaviour that even displays outside of presupposition denials. It also argues that the distribution of even and any in imperatives and modal statements lends support to views that treat imperatives as containing an existential modal operator that is sometimes strengthened by exhaustification to yield universal readings.},

Game theory offers rich tools for representing formal language games and ways of reasoning about them. Game theoretic approaches to pragmatics have been pioneered by Prashant Parikh as in (1991, 1992, 2001) but have since been accompanied by several different alternatives with a growing range of applications (see Benz, Jäger, and van Rooij, 2006; Franke, 2013a; Jäger, 2008, for overview) When it comes to tackling pragmatic reasoning along the lines envisaged by Grice (1975) models that spell out pragmatic back-and-forth reasoning are particularly relevant. Pragmatic back-and-forth reasoning is reasoning by speakers and hearers about what each other believes, does, believes his interlocutor does and so on. For instance, the general intuitive reasoning scheme behind a scalar inference is pragmatic back-and-forth reasoning of this kind: “I should not interpret ‘some’ to mean ‘all’ (although that would not be ruled out by semantic meaning), because, if the speaker had wanted me to do so, he would have said ‘all’.”},

  abstract = {In certain situations a past tense marker in conjunction with another word, gives a sentence a counterfactual meaning. For example “In present day English “if you competed tomorrow, you would win” implies that the competing (and the winning) will probably not take place. That is the past tense marker in conjunction with "if" gives an irrealis vibe to the sentence. Also the past tense meaning has been lost.~ There is a grammatical process behind this shift of meaning. I describe four "pathways" that have produced counterfactuality within the historical English period. I contend that this process split "ought" from "owe" and "might" from "may" well over a thousand years ago. And more recently split "should" from "shall", "would" from "will" and "could" from "can". In present day English, in certain situations the first element is simply the past of the second element. But this is just a holdover from ancient times. All ten words listed here are definitely separate words. You might has noticed that I mentioned "irrealis vibe" in the first paragraph. This is because the counterfactual (or irrealis, same thing) markers are never absolute, they are never 100\% counterfactual. Indeed we have negation markers for that job (like "not" (usually along with "do") in English). I believe that all counterfactual markers have a valve of about "90\% not going to happen" (AKA 90\% counterfactual or 90\% irrealis) when they first split off from the mother word. However over time, this percentage can vary, as indeed any part of the meaning can vary.~ One could say that counterfactual markers are the unintended detritus of an unplanned grammaticalization process. OK, but are they useful ? Mmmh, well they are used. So I guess you could say that they are useful. But we mustn't be so self-centred to think that all that exists in nature is put there to serve us.},

The embedded clause is regarded as declarative under the direct-dependency approach but as interrogative under the indirect-dependency approach. What is especially interesting in this respect is that Japanese wh-scope marking requires the embedded clause to be marked by the interrogative complementizer ka. Japanese wh-scope marking thus provides clear morphological evidence for the indirect-dependency approach.},

I begin by presenting a popular sketch of a pragmatic solution to the puzzle, due to Kratzer and Shimoyama (Proceedings of the third Tokyo conference on psycholinguistics, 2002), which has received a good deal of discussion, endorsement and elaboration in recent work (Aloni and van Rooij, Proccedings of the KNAW Academy Colloquium: Cognitive foundations of interpretation, 2004; Alonso-Ovalle, Ph.D. thesis, 2006; Chierchia, Linguist Inq 37(4):535–590, 2006; Fox, in: Sauerland and Stateva (eds.) Presupposition and implicature in compositional semantics, 2007; Geurts, Mind Lang 24:51–79, 2009; von Fintel, Central APA session on Deontic Modals, 2012). I then explain why the general form of the Kratzer and Shimoyama explanation is not extensionally adequate. This leaves us with two possibilities with regard to the original solution-sketch; either the suggested pragmatic route fails, or it succeeds in a particularly strange way: Free Choice permission is rendered a kind pragmatic illusion on the part of both speakers and hearers. Finally, I discuss some ramifications.},

Two basic approaches to local implicatures have been advanced: a fully pragmatic account in which local implicatures result from conventional Gricean principles and a semantic account according to which the generation of implicatures is interwoven with compositional, grammatical mechanisms. We argue that the lesson to be learned from our three case studies is that some kind of approach along the latter, grammatical line is necessary to account for the data.},

Strong NPIs see both the truth-conditional and non-truth-conditional (scalar implications, presuppositions) meaning of their licensers. This theory accounts for the puzzling inability, noted by Rullmann and Gajewski, of Strawson anti-additive operators to license strong NPIs, as well as for the effects of Zwarts’s hierarchy of negative strength. Additional issues concerning comparative quantifiers, few, and proportional quantifiers are addressed.},

Discussion centers around the analysis of a licensing asymmetry noted in Horn (1971, Negative transportation: Unsafe at any speed? In CLS 7 (pp. 120–133)).Having provided this analysis, I go on to discuss its implications for the theory of NPI-licensing more generally.

The primary source of support for my position on Neg-Raising comes from the natural way in which the approach explains a variety of facts about NPI-licensing in environments containing Neg-Raising predicates. In Chapter 2, a principled account is offered of a previously ill-understood contrast in NPI-licensing under stacked Neg-Raising predicates, first pointed out in Horn (1972). Also addressed are facts advanced in favor of the syntactic theory of Neg-Raising by Kiparsky and Kiparsky (1970) and Prince (1976). Horn's (1989) attractive account of Neg-Raising is reviewed in detail in Chapter 3 and found to have deficiencies, particularly in the domain of NPI-licensing. The most compelling aspect of Horn's analysis is his derivation of Neg-Raising from general principles. The purposes of Chapters 4 and 5 is to develop an alternative analysis of Neg-Raising that attains a comparable depth of explanation. First, I compare the behavior of negated Neg-Raising predicates to that of negated definite plurals.},

Previous analyses of EPs are shown to fail to solve these puzzles. A new unified solution to the two puzzles is proposed. The crucial insight of the analysis is to allow von Fintel’s (Natural Language Semantics 1: 123–148, 1993; Restrictions on quantifier domains, PhD dissertation, 1994) leastness condition on EPs to be imposed at scopes non-local to the surface position of the EP. A general result is derived concerning the truth conditions of sentences in which an existential modified by an EP occurs in the scope of a downward entailing operator. The distribution of EPs is argued to depend on how the leastness condition interacts with other pragmatic strengthening conditions, such as the one imposed on any by Kadmon and Landman (Linguistics and Philosophy 16: 353–422, 1993).},

Specifically, non-conservative \%Qs appear low in the structure, inside the VP, whereas conservative \%Qs either appear in their canonical position, depending on their syntactic role as subject or object (German, Bulgarian), or high/VP-externally (the other Slavic languages). We propose that non-conservative \%Qs are always interpreted low and combine with the predicate on a par with semantically incorporated nominals and, with intransitves, existential constructions. We argue against previous accounts that ascribe a crucial role to focus for the non-conservative reading to arise, in taking focus to merely be derivative from the requirement of non-conservative \%Qs to appear low, paired with a general rule for sentential stress placement.},

  abstract = {Following Zimmermann (2000), I propose that disjunctions are to be treated as conjunctions of modal propositions, and that the essential contribution of ‘or’ is merely to present a list of alternatives. Any further ingredients in the interpretation of a disjunctive sentence (such as exhaustivity) are due to extraneous factors; they are not part of the meaning of ‘or’. My analysis differs from Zimmermann’s in that it is more general and renders the logical form of disjunctive sentences less complex, but the main innovation is that the context dependence of modality is called upon to play a leading role. The theory applies not only to disjunctions of ‘may’-sentences but also covers universal modalities and conditional disjuncts. The paper concludes with a discussion of narrow-scope ‘or’.},

  abstract = {Plural marking on mass nouns in languages like English and Persian is assumed to be allowed only when the interpretation of the mass noun is subject to coercion — i.e. count reading of mass nouns. As such, plural marking serves the purpose of portioning out the undivided stuff into conventionalized units. This chapter presents facts establishing that plural marking on mass nouns in Persian, in addition to its portioning-out function, can induce definiteness. The chapter proposes that the definiteness interpretation triggered by plural morphology arises from the syntax of plural marking in Persian. Based on the descriptive generalizations made in this chapter, a Distributed-Morphology based analysis is proposed of number marking in Persian and how it interfaces with definiteness marking. I argue that number morphology in the context of definite noun phrases is syncretic in the sense that it realizes both a definiteness feature [+def] and a number feature [±pl].},

First, do these concepts form part of a universally shared and uniform mental capacity? Second, are the concepts expressed in all languages? And third, are they always realized in the same way in grammars cross-linguistically and if not, what are the various ways that they are encoded in language? The paper places a range of work on the count mass distinction against these three questions, and presents various perspectives found in the literature. The conclusion is that while all humans have the relevant concepts, language can vary as to if and how they are expressed due to the mediating effect of grammar, with the result that there are a variety of realizations of the concepts across languages.},

Empirical support for this analysis will be provided by a detailed examination of affective dependencies in Greek, but the distribution of any will also be shown to follow from (non)veridicality.},

  abstract = {In this paper we reconsider the issue of free choice and the role of the wh-morphology employed in it. We show that the property of being an interrogative wh-word alone is not sufficient for free choice, and that semantic and sometimes even morphological definiteness is a pre-requisite for some free choice items (FCIs) in certain languages, e.g. in Greek and Mandarin Chinese. We propose a theory that explains the polarity behaviour of FCIs cross-linguistically, and allows indefinite (Giannakidou 2001) as well as definite-like FCIs. The difference is manifested as a lexical distinction in English between any (indefinite) and wh-ever (definite); in Greek it appears as a choice between a FCI nominal modifier (taking an NP argument), which illustrates the indefinite option, and a FC free relative illustrating the definite one. We provide a compositional analysis of Greek FCIs in both incarnations, and derive in a parallel manner the Chinese FCIs. Here the definite versus indefinite alternation is manifested in the presence or absence of dōu, which we take to express the maximality operator. It is thus shown that what we see in the morphology of FCIs in Greek is reflected in syntax in Chinese.Our analysis has important consequences for the class of so-called wh-indeterminates. In the context of current proposals, free choiceness is taken to come routinely from interrogative semantics, and wh-indeterminates are treated as question words which can freely become FCIs (Kratzer and Shimoyama 2002). Our results from Mandarin and Greek emphasize that wh-indeterminates do not form a uniform class in this respect, and that interrogative semantics alone cannot predict either sensitivity of free choice to definiteness, or the polarity behaviour of FCIs.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I discuss the distribution and interpretation of free choice items (FCIs) in Greek, a language exhibiting a lexical paradigm of such items distinct from that of negative polarity items. Greek differs in this respect from English, which uniformly employs any. FCIs are grammatical only in certain contexts that can be characterized as nonveridical (Giannakidou 1998, 1999), and although they yield universal-like interpretations in certain structures, they are not, I argue, universal quantifiers. Evidence will be provided that FCIsare indefinites; the quasi-universal effect is shown to be the result of binding by an operator with universal force. Additionally, the limited distribution of FCIs in non veridical contexts can be accounted for by analyzing them as indefinites which must always be interpreted in an intensional type. The difference between ``regular'' indefinites and FCIs, therefore, is reduced to a type difference which captures the fact that only the latter exhibit limited distribution: because of their intensional type, FCIs will be grammatical only in contexts providing alternatives (worlds or situations), and nonveridical contexts do exactly this. By contrast, FCIs are excluded from veridical and episodic contexts because these provide no alternatives and hence do not satisfy the lexical semantic requirement ofFCIs. The proposed analysis is supported by data from other languages as well (Spanish, Catalan,French) and has important consequences regarding the analysis of English any. If FCIs are not universal quantifiers but indefinites, then the usual ambiguity thesis (free choice any being universal, negative polarity any an existential) can no longer be maintained, at least not as one in terms of quantificational force.},

  abstract = {The main focus of this article is the occurrence of some polarity items (PIs) in the complements of emotive factive verbs and only. This fact has been taken as a challenge to the semantic approach to PIs (Linebarger 1980), because only and factive verbs are not downward entailing (DE). A modification of the classical DE account is proposed by introducing the notion of nonveridicality (Zwarts 1995, Giannakidou 1998, 1999, 2001) as the one crucial for PI sanctioning. To motivate this move, it is first shown that two solutions in the direction of weakening classical monotonicity do not work: Strawson DE (von Fintel 1999) and weak DE (Hoeksema 1986). Weakening DE systematically either overgenerates or undergenerates, in either case failing to characterize the correct set of licensers. Nonveridicality is introduced as a conservative extension of DE and is shown to account for PIs also in contexts that are not DE (i.e. questions, modal verbs, imperatives, directive propositional attitudes). This theory, augmented with the premise that certain PIs (i.e. the liberal class represented by any) are subject to a weaker polarity dependency identified not as LICENSING but as RESCUING by nonveridicality, explains the occurrence of this particular class with only and emotive factive verbs. Crosslinguistic comparisons illustrate that the occurrence of PIs with only and emotive factives is not a general phenomenon, and further support the dual nature of polarity dependency and the semantic characterization of the elements that license or rescue PIs.},

The paper begins with a battery of impossibility results showing that Free Choice is in tension with a variety of classical principles, including Disjunction Introduction and the Law of Excluded Middle. Most interestingly, Free Choice appears incompatible with a principle concerning the behavior of disjunctive possibility modals under negation, Double Prohibition, which says that Mary can’t have soup or salad implies Mary can’t have soup and Mary can’t have salad. Alonso-Ovalle 2006 and others have appealed to Double Prohibition to motivate pragmatic accounts of Free Choice. Aher 2012, Aloni 2018, and others have developed semantic accounts of Free Choice that also explain Double Prohibition.This paper offers a new semantic analysis of Free Choice designed to handle the full range of impossibility results involved in Free Choice. The paper develops the hypothesis that Free Choice is a homogeneity effect. The claim possibly A or B is defined only when A and B are homogenous with respect to their modal status, either both possible or both impossible. Paired with a notion of entailment that is sensitive to definedness conditions, this theory validates Free Choice while retaining a wide variety of classical principles except for the transitivity of entailment. The homogeneity hypothesis is implemented in two different ways, homogeneous alternative semantics and homogeneous dynamic semantics, with interestingly different consequences. BibTeX info},

  abstract = {Typologically, many languages have indefinite pronouns that are derived from interrogative pronouns. In fact, some indefinite pronouns assume the same morphological shape as their interrogative counterparts. Such words are termed quexistentials: they take on an indefinite or interrogative reading depending on the sentence environments in which they are licensed. Hengeveld et al. (2021) argue that indefinite quexistentials only appear in non-focused environments, whereas their interrogative counterparts only appear in focused environments. With Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (Oto-Manguean) as the empirical focus of this thesis, I expand the typology of quexistentials presented by Hengeveld et al.

I use Karttunen’s (1977) semantics for questions to unite indefinite and interrogative quexistentials into having the same generalized quantifier semantics. The difference in their interpretations arises from the syntax-semantics interface – in particular, whether the quexistential composes with an interrogative operator.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the projection behavior of presuppositions embedded under the predicate say. Drawing from new data elicited in French, German, Italian and English, we show that with say presuppositions from embedded declaratives and those from embedded interrogatives pattern in opposite ways. Specifically, presuppositions from declaratives must be satisfied at the attitude holder’s level, in their ‘presented beliefs’, but not at the matrix level; from interrogatives, presuppositions project to the matrix level, but not the attitude holder’s level. This result differs from the general pattern observed with responsive predicates. To capture this projection behavior, we propose a mechanism for declarative embedding that ensures for presuppositions to be satisfied in the same worlds at which the prejacent will be evaluated, here the attitude holder’s presented beliefs. In addition, we assume that say cannot directly embed interrogatives, and instead, when it appears to embed a question Q, it is selecting for a silent DP ‘the answer to Q’. Matrix projection follows on standard assumptions.},

I show that polarity focus creates challenges for classic theories of focus (e.g. Rooth 1992, a.o.) that can be dealt with by requiring that all focus marking is truly contrastive, and that givenness deaccenting imposes its own distinct requirement on prominence shifts. To enforce true contrast, I employ innocent exclusion (Fox 2007), which I suggest may impose a general filter on what counts as a valid alternative. A key, novel feature of my account is that focal targets are split into two kinds, those that are contextually supported and those that are constructed ad hoc, and that the presence of a contextually supported target can block the ability to construct an ad hoc target. This enables a novel explanation of the data motivating true contrast, and enables polarity focus to be brought into the fold of a unified and truly contrastive theory of focus. I then compare the account to theories of verum focus that make use of non-focus-based verum operators, and make the argument that the focus account is more parsimonious and has better empirical coverage.},

Which particles do speakers prefer to use when? Are preference patterns sensitive to the polarity of preceding sentences in the context? In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the contradiction contour (Liberman \&amp; Sag 1974) is an intonation that is commonly produced on positive responses to negative sentences, and that it affects hearers’ interpretations of bare particle responses. Beyond intonation, our experimental results add new evidence regarding speakers’ preferences for using yes and no in response to negative polar questions and rising declaratives. Finally, our results suggest that preference patterns are not sensitive to the polarity of context sentences.},

  abstract = {I show that speaker bias in polarity focus questions (PFQs) is context sensitive, while speaker bias in high negation questions (HNQs) is context insensitive. This leads me to develop separate accounts of speaker bias in each of these kinds of polar questions. I argue that PFQ bias derives from the fact that they are frequently used in conversational contexts in which an answer to the question has already been asserted by an interlocutor, thus expressing doubt about the prior assertion. This derivation explains their context sensitivity, and the fact that similar bias arises from polar questions that lack polarity focus. I also provide novel evidence that the prejacents of HNQs lack negation, and thus only have an outer negation reading (see, e.g., Ladd in Papers from the seventeenth regional meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society, vol. 17, pp. 164–171, 1981; Romero and Han in Linguistics and Philosophy 27(5):609–658, 2004; Krifka in Contrastiveness in information structure, alternatives and scalar implicatures, pp. 359–398, 2017; AnderBois in Questions in discourse, pp. 118–171, 2019; Frana and Rawlins in Semantics and Pragmatics 12(16):1–48, 2019; Jeong in Journal of Semantics 38(1):49–94, 2020). Based on a treatment of HNQs as denoting unbalanced partitions (Romero and Han in Linguistics and Philosophy 27(5):609–658, 2004), and competition with their positive polar question alternatives, I propose a novel derivation of speaker bias in HNQs as a conversational implicature. Roughly, if the speaker is ignorant, then a positive polar question will be more useful because it is more informative, so the use of an HNQ conveys that the speaker is not ignorant. The denotation of the HNQ then makes clear which way the speaker is biased. The result separates high negation from verum focus, and I argue that it is more parsimonious and has better empirical coverage than prior accounts.},

At the same time, it is well known that these three question types have different distributions. In particular, they have different requirements with respect to contextual evidence for the answers, the Evidential Condition on polar questions. Despite widespread discussion of this fact, no universally accepted explanation has emerged. In this paper, I make the novel argument that high negation questions do not have an Evidential Condition, and so only the conditions for positive and low negation questions need to be explained. I then argue that an explanation can be given based on general principles of markedness and information structure, even while maintaining a classic \{p, not-p\} semantics for both positive and low negation questions. I discuss ramifications for polar question semantics.},

  abstract = {Disjunctions in the scope of possibility modals give rise to a conjunctive inference, generally referred to as ‘free choice.’ For example, Emma can take Spanish or Calculus suggests that Emma can take Spanish and can take Calculus. This inference is not valid on standard semantics for modals in combination with a Boolean semantics for disjunction. Hence free choice has sparked a whole industry of theories in philosophy of language and semantics. This paper investigates free choice in sentences involving a non-monotonic modified numeral, under which we embed a possibility modal scoping over disjunction. One example is Exactly one student can(not) take Spanish or Calculus. As we point out, the presence (or absence) of certain readings of these sentences is a key test for a prominent approach, which analyzes free choice as a kind of scalar implicature. We report on two experiments investigating the readings of such sentences, using an inferential task. Our results are challenging for the implicature approach. We sketch two possible solutions within this approach, either adopting a different recent implicature algorithm, or exploring a different meaning for modified numerals with exactly. Both of them suffer from a variety of problems. We then discuss a third solution, which exploits a recent account of free choice based on homogeneity. This approach can account for our results, in combination with plausible assumptions about homogeneity projection, though it too has open issues with related cases. Regardless of which solution is chosen, non-monotonic contexts turn out to be an important test case for theories of free choice, implicature, and modified numerals.},

In a recent paper, Lin (Syntax 18:320–342, 2015) argues for the positive view. The argument is based on the premise that Mandarin clauses exhibit finite/nonfinite contrasts and that finiteness is a property of Tense. In this paper, I argue that the contrasts identified by Lin can all be adequately accounted for without appealing to Tense. The primary conclusion then is that finiteness contrasts do not constitute evidence for Tense in Mandarin. A secondary conclusion is that Mandarin can nonetheless be said to exhibit a finite/nonfinite distinction, but only if ‘finiteness’ is construed broadly as a cluster of properties that enable a clause to stand alone as a syntactically unembedded assertion. Phenomena considered in making this argument include both those discussed by Lin (object fronting, wide scope of object-position quantifiers, and a scopal interaction between modals and aspect) as well as the syntax of subject position and the grammar of control.},

  abstract = {Recent work on mood choice considers fine-grained semantic differences among desire predicates (notably, ‘want’ and ‘hope’) and their consequences for the distribution of indicative and subjunctive complement clauses. In that vein, this paper takes a close look at ‘intend’. I show that cross-linguistically, ‘intend’ accepts nonfinite and subjunctive complements and rejects indicative complements. This fact poses difficulties for recent approaches to mood choice. Toward a solution, a broad aim of this paper is to argue that—while ‘intend’ is loosely in the family of desire predicates—it differs from ‘want’ and ‘hope’ in that it has a causative component, and this is relevant to its mood choice behavior, given that causative predicates also systematically reject indicative complements. More concretely, my analysis has three ingredients: (i) following related proposals in philosophy, intention reports have causally self-referential content; (ii) encoding causal self-reference requires abstraction over the complement clause’s eventuality argument; and (iii) nonfinite and subjunctive clauses enable such abstraction but indicative clauses do not. Aside from causative predicates, independent support for the proposal comes from the syntax of belief-/intention-hybrid attitude predicates like ‘decide’ and ‘convince’, anankastic conditional antecedents, aspectual predicates, and memory and perception reports. Synthesizing this result with that of previous literature, the emergent generalization is that subjunctive mood occurs in attitude reports that involve either comparison or eventuality abstraction. Toward a unified theory of mood choice, I suggest that both comparison and eventuality abstraction represent departures from the clausal semantics of unembedded assertions and consequently that subjunctive mood signals such a departure.},

I show that whereas both IS and BP generics tolerate exceptional and contextually irrelevant individuals and situations in a strikingly similar way, which indicates the existence of a basically equivalent tolerance mechanism, there is also a difference between them, unnoticed so far, which concerns the degree to which the properties of the legitimate exceptions can be characterized in advance. Following claims in Greenberg (2003), I argue that both this newly observed difference as well as the traditional felicity differences result from an underlying contrast in the type of ‘non-accidentalness’ expressed by the two types of generic sentences, and more formally, in the accessibility relations that their generic quantifier (Gen) is compatible with. To capture the new difference in tolerance of exceptions, I develop an improved version of the exceptions-tolerance mechanism for generic sentences suggested in Kadmon \&amp; Landman (1993), namely, a restriction on the set of individuals and situations quantified by Gen, which is partially vague to two different degrees using supervaluationist methods. The different degrees of vagueness in this restriction are shown to be systematically dependent on the two types of accessibility relations that IS and BP generics are compatible with, which are redefined as precise and vague restrictions on the generic quantification over worlds.},

In particular, I look at the unexpected infelicity of even p in the context of a salient p or q alternative.

  abstract = {This paper deals with a newly observed phenomenon which lies at the interface of the semantics and pragmatics of aspectual still (as in John is still asleep), namely the fact that still is infelicitous when it appears in past tense sentences whose reference time is not specified by some temporal adverbial or the utterance context. The main claim of the paper is that in such sentences, the truth of the assertion and that of the ‘prior time’ presupposition this particle triggers can be both inferred from the truth of the minimally contrasting still-less counterpart. Moreover, in such cases the presuppositional status of the ‘prior time’ claim is lost. Hence, the use of still in such sentences is uninformative and thus infelicitous. The analysis has several more general theoretical implications. Concerning the semantics of still, it shows that the novel data cannot be accounted for by using current definitions of the presupposition triggered by still. Instead, a modified definition of still is developed, which, following Ippolito (2007), uses one eventuality variable in both the assertion and the presupposition of sentences with still but, unlike this theory, does not require the denotation of this variable to be contextually salient. As for the analysis of tense and temporal structure of clauses, the interaction of still with frame adverbials supports the view that such adverbials denote intervals identical to the reference time of the sentence, rather than including it. In addition, the paper argues that the contrast between felicitous and infelicitous cases of still can only be explained if, contrary to many current analyses, we assume that past tense is not necessarily anaphoric but can be represented in some cases as a new variable bound by existential closure.

  abstract = {This paper concentrates on giving precise content to the general wisdom on the scalar presupposition of even, according to which the prejacent of even, p, is stronger than its relevant focus alternatives, q. To that end I first examine both familiar challenges for the popular ‘comparative likelihood’ view of the ‘stronger than’ relation, as well as novel challenges, having to do with the context dependency of even (with entailed and non-entailed alternatives) and with its sensitivity to standards of comparison. To overcome these challenges and to account for the full range of data I develop a revised, ‘gradability-based’ scalar presupposition for even, which differs from the ‘comparative likelihood’ one in several respects: instead of directly comparing degrees to which propositions (namely p and q) are more or less likely, we compare extents to which non-focus entities x in p and q (in the accessible p worlds and the exhaustified q worlds) exceed the salient standard on a scale associated with a contextually supplied gradable property G. To capture cases where information about contrastive topics is crucial for fixing two distinct standards on G, I follow theories which view even as a general, two-place alternative-sensitive operator, allowing it to associate with both focus and contrastive topics. Beyond the ability to account for a large range of intricate felicity variations and inferences found with even, a more general contribution of the paper lies in showing the linguistic relevance of tools originally developed in the literature on gradable predicates to the semantics of scalar alternative–sensitive particles.},

  abstract = {An old observation about the focus sensitive particles only and even is that they are in some sense scalar antonyms. We examine three schematic proposals raised in the literature to capture this observation, namely that only vs. even presuppose that the proposition denoted by their prejacent, p, is lower vs. higher, respectively (A) than what is EXPECTED/the default STANDARD (the ‘mirative/evaluative antonymy’ view), (B) than SOME (salient) alternative in the set of contextually relevant focus alternatives, C, (the ‘existential antonymy’ view), or (C) than ALL alternatives in C (the ‘superlative antonymy’ view). To tease these views apart, we examine the behavior of only vs. even in a wide range of contexts and types of discourse, concentrating on the way the C set of contextually relevant alternatives with only (C) (p) and even (C) (p) is constrained by the interaction of (i) previously uttered sentences and (ii) the salient QUD. Based on these examinations we argue for the preferability of the ‘superlative antonymy’ view of only and even. In contrast, we argue that the ‘existential’ antonymy and the ‘mirative/evaluative’ antonymy between only and even are apparent. The former only holds in specific contexts where one alternative to p is made maximally salient. As to the latter, we show that while an evaluative (‘above the standard’ / ‘a lot’) inference is hardwired into the scalar presupposition of even, alongside the superlative inference, the mirror imaged one (‘below the standard’ / ‘a little’) is cancellable for only. We propose that this inference can be derived from the interaction of the superlative scalar presupposition of only and domain based constraints on alternatives in C.},

The chapter argues that individuation, the same semantic principle which has been invoked in accounting for the count-mass distinction, also extends to the count domain and explains the core of the nominal pattern in Dagaare. An examination of Dagaare's lexicon demonstrates that nouns designating highly individuated referents are morphologically marked in the plural, while nouns designating less individuated referents, viz. those which tend to come in groups or pairs, are morphologically marked in the singular. This general view is supported both by other phenomena within Dagaare, such as the domain of diminutives and dialect variation, and by cross-linguistic facts that surface in a wide array of language types. A formal semantic analysis of the number marking system is then provided and the implications for formal models of plurality are explored.},

We model listeners' update of their prior beliefs about the causal structure of the world and the joint probabilities of the consequent and antecedent based on assumptions about the speaker's utterance production protocol. We show that, when supplied with natural contextual assumptions, our model uniformly explains a number of inferences attested in the literature, including epistemic inferences, conditional perfection and the dependency between antecedent and consequent of a conditional. We argue that this approach also helps explain three puzzles introduced by Douven (2012) about updating with conditionals: depending on the utterance context, the listener's belief in the antecedent may increase, decrease or remain unchanged.},

We use compatibility with ‘usually’ as a test for genericity, because even non-generic referential plural definites (say [The NPs] in English) can restrict some adverbs of quantification, including ‘generally’, an often overlooked fact. The relationship between (b) and (c) has been observed, but their connection with (a) has gone unnoticed, and our generalization, to our knowledge, has never been formulated as such.

  abstract = {English bare plurals and Italian definite plurals are considered kind-denoting as they support kind predication, as in `lions are extinct'. In this work, I argue that tools used for referential plurals, such as the distributive operator DIST, should be extended to kind- denoting plurals. As a result, at least three distributional puzzles fall in line. Unlike singular indefinites, kind-denoting plurals: (i) are compatible with both contingent and law-like generalizations (Lawler, 1973; Greenberg, 2002), (ii) support cumulative predication (Nickel, 2008; Kirkpatrick, 2022), and (iii) can exhibit near-universal force in non-generic contexts (Condoravdi, 1994; Dayal, 2004). Concerning (i), all generalizations, contingent and law-like, have traditionally been assumed to involve generic quantification. This paper posits that bona fide generic quantification is instead exclusive to the LF of law-like generalizations (`Madrigals are polyphonic.'/`A madrigal is polyphonic'). Singular indefinites, as property-denoting, are predicted to support such generalizations just like kind-denoting plurals, as the silent quantificational adverb Gen can be restricted both by properties and by kinds. I propose that accidental generalizations instead result from an LF in which the predicate is distributed over members of the kind in the actual world via DIST. DIST acts on sums, not properties, hence we predict that kind-denoting plurals, but not singular indefinites, have such an LF, i.e. one that supports accidental generalizations: `Madrigals are popular' is perceived as true, whereas `A madrigal is popular' isn't. Additionally, I show how this view sheds light on a surprising novel data point from Italian, where a relative clause in the subjunctive mood modifying the subject DP forces a law-like reading of the sentence. Similar strategies address the infelicity of singular indefinites in puzzles (ii) and (iii). I conclude the paper considering existential uses of bare plurals in episodic generalizations in English, illustrating that these are not merely non-maximal versions of kind-predication. Cer- tain expressions cannot denote kinds due to their descriptive content, yet appear in existential episodic sentences. Combining this insight with the view defended for puzzles (i), (ii), and (iii) prompts a fresh look at Chierchia’s (1998) theory of cross-linguistic variation of the in- terpretation of nominals and the Nominal Mapping Parameter it proposes. With appropriate adaptations, this device can successfully predict the interpretational properties of English and Italian bare and definite plurals.},

In exploring these cases, I aim is to contribute new empirical evidence and theoretical insight pertinent to the general issue of how presuppositions project in interrogative environments. Although the phenomenon of presuppositions has received considerable attention in previous work, very little is understood about how precisely presuppositions project in the domain of questions. My main goal is to establish what processes generate presuppositions in questions, starting from what we know about the semantics of questions and about the contribution of expressions introducing presuppositions in declaratives. The strategy I pursue in this investigation consists in looking at cases where presuppositional material affects the interpretation of a question in ways that go beyond the mere introduction of a presupposition. Even and certain NPIs (so called 'minimizers') provide a rich and constrained testing ground in this sense, as they can be exploited to signal that a questioning act is meant to be biased towards a negative answer. This thesis argues that this otherwise puzzling property of questions with minimizers and even can be understood as a product of (i) the way the presuppositions of even project in a question and affect the question denotation; and (ii) the way general pragmatic principles governing what it means to ask a question regulate how the resulting denotation can be used by speakers in a given context.},

  abstract = {Truthmaker semantics is a formal system of linguistic meaning, recently developed by Kit Fine and Stephen Yablo. Fine and Yablo argue that it provides novel and interesting solutions to various outstanding issues faced by alternative frameworks of linguistic meaning, most notably the possible-worlds framework. The possible-worlds framework is originally developed to solve the problems faced by the earlier truth-functional treatments of language such as Ludwig Wittgenstein’s. The possible-worlds framework was especially successful in modeling modals and conditionals. This dissertation focuses on modals and conditionals, but from the perspective of truthmaker semantics. The general theme consists in exploring issues stemming from the possible-worlds treatment of modals and conditionals, especially counterfactuals such as “If it had rained, the party would have been cancelled”, necessity claims such as “It must have rained yesterday” and possibility claims such as “It might have rained yesterday”. Chapter 1 argues that the logic of counterfactuals as validated by the possible-worlds models developed by David Lewis and Robert Stalnaker makes counterintuitive predictions due to their permission to substitute the antecedent of any counterfactual with a logically equivalent antecedent. I show the truthmaker semantics can make the right predictions for the cases to be discussed. Chapter 2 takes on one of the oldest puzzles about epistemic necessity. The literature reached a stalemate about the logical strength of the epistemic modals such as “It must be raining”. Some argued “It must have rained” entails “It rained” and some argued it does not. I argue this is a false dilemma by disambiguating the sense of entailment involved in the debate. Truthmaker semantics naturally gives rise to many different senses of entailment. I demonstrate that the sense of entailment for epistemic necessity arises from a different sense of entailment than the lack thereof. Chapter 3 focuses on possibilities. Philosophers and logicians often talk about possibilities as if they could be reduced to possible worlds, situations or states of affairs. However, looking at the behavior of possibility-denoting expressions such as the possibility that it is raining outside right now in extensional environments tell a different story. In particular, possibilities cannot be reduced to possible entities, be it worlds, situations or states of affairs. I argue that there are independent principles in truthmaker semantics which drive us to this conclusion independently and force us to postulate possibilities as entities of their own kind. I provide an interpre- tation of these irreducible possibilities by relying on evidence from cognitive science as well.},

The prosodic experimental studies reveal how focus shapes prosody and how diverse languages encode such information packaging. Drawing on the findings of experimental studies reflecting the interaction of information structure with quantifier scope, negation and aspectual markers,clause internal functional projections and scope domains are proposed in the syntactic analysis. The analysis offers new perspectives for movement operations, functional categories, phases which are central themes for the Minimalist Program.Building on the investigation of information structure within semantic, prosodic, syntactic perspectives, the book will appeal to researchers working on either of these domains or their interfaces.},

Focus phrases are differentiated not based on a designated syntactic position or the feature of contrast but based on exhaustive identification with contrastive focus phrases. The prosodic properties of focus phrases in SOV order indicate that (i) when focus is in the immediately preverbal position, contrastive focus and discourse-new focus and broad focus sentences do not differ significantly with respect to duration or pitch height at any of the measurement points, (ii) focus in sentence initial, medial or final domains is always marked as the rightmost phonological phrase with intonational phrase level prominence, which marks the beginning of the nuclear fall. The syntactic investigation of the interaction of information structural units with negation and quantifier scope illustrate that all movement operations are driven by discourseinterpretational purposes. Additionally, vP does not show phasehood properties and the derivation of the data is captured via eventual, situational, and propositional domains and clause-internal functional projections. In the absence of TP, (i) CP does not show phasehood properties as evidenced by binding data, ECM clauses, bounding nodes, (ii) temporal information is encoded as a secondary effect of Mood.},

  abstract = {Proportional quantifiers have played a central role in the development of formal semantics because they set a benchmark for the expressive power needed to describe quantification in natural language (Barwise and Cooper Linguist Philos 4:159–219, 1981). The proportional quantifier most, in particular, supplied the initial motivation for adopting Generalized Quantifier Theory (GQT) because its meaning is definable as a relation between sets of individuals, which are taken to be semantic primitives in GQT. This paper proposes an alternative analysis of most that does not treat it as a lexical item whose meaning is accessible without the help of compositional processes. Instead, proportional most is analyzed as the superlative of many (cf. Bresnan Linguist Inq 4(3):274–344, 1973). Two types of empirical evidence are presented in support of this view, both exploiting the fact that only a decompositional analysis of proportional quantifiers provides the means to generate different logical forms for seemingly equivalent statements of the form most A B and more than half of the A B.},

FIRs invariably receive a modal interpretation even in the absence of any overt modal verb. The modal interpretation seems to come in two distinct types, which can be paraphrased by finite relative clauses employing the modal auxiliaries should and could. The two puzzles presented here arise because the availability of the two readings is constrained by factors that are not otherwise known to affect the interpretation of a relative clause. Specifically, we show, first, that “strong” determiners require the FIR to be interpreted as a SHOULD-relative while “weak” determiners allow both interpretations (the Determiner-Modal Generalization). Secondly, we observe that the COULD-interpretation requires a raising (internally headed) structure for the FIR, while the SHOULD-interpretation is compatible with either a raising or a more standard matching (externally headed) structure (the Raising/Matching Generalization).},

This crosslinguistic trend supports a Kratzerian analysis, where each modal has a core lexical entry and where the difference between an epistemic and a root interpretation is contextually determined. A long-standing problem for such a unified account is the equally robust crosslinguistic correlation between a modal’s interpretation and its syntactic behavior: epistemics scope high (in particular higher than tense and aspect) and roots low, a fact which has led to proposals that hardwire different syntactic positions for epistemics and roots (cf. Cinque’s hierarchy). This paper argues that the range of interpretations a modal receives is even more restricted: a modal must be keyed to certain time-individual pairs, but not others. I show that this can be captured straightforwardly by minimally modifying the Kratzerian account: modals are relative to an event—rather than a world—of evaluation, which readily provides a time (the event’s running time) and (an) individual(s) (the event’s participants). I propose that this event relativity of modals can in turn explain the correlation between type of interpretation and syntactic position, without stipulation of an interpretation-specific height for modals.},

In this paper, I make the novel observation that, to account for functional readings of sentences like Which picture that John1 liked did he1 show no girl?, a covert type-shifting operator formulated in Jacobson (2002; Direct Compositionality and Variable-Free Semantics: The Case of Binding into Heads, in Proceedings of SALT 12, p. 144-163, Cornell University) and is quite similar to, but still critically different from, Engdahl’s is necessary to type-shift the relative clause containing John because it must be interpreted only upstairs to account for the lack of disjoint reference effect.

I then develop a new semantics for plural predication on which non-distributive and non-maximal construals form a natural class. The system extends the idea that non-maximality involves truth-value gaps (e.g. Križ 2015) to non-distributive construals by making use of Schmitt’s (2019) ‘plural projection’ framework, in which plural sentences involve special composition rules.},

This paper proposes an account in terms of trade-offs between pragmatic preferences, including a preference for simpler structures and a preference for avoiding imprecision. When combined with certain assumptions about when two sentences compete, this perspective can account for the markedness asymmetry between plural definites and *all*-type QPs, and the lack of a similarly consistent asymmetry between definites and indefinites.},

Contra Fox and Katzir, the crucial structural criterion is not complexity per se, but similarity to the prejacent. Moreover, this property only applies to break stalemates between symmetric alternatives; in the absence of stalemates, alternatives are structurally unconstrained. We suggest that while assumptions (i) and (ii) have good empirical consequences, this account is not entirely successful because (iii) is too strong: In certain special cases, which seem to have an information-structural characterization, stalemates can be broken by relevance.},

We present a surface-compositional and event-less analysis of this pattern, expanding Schmitt's (2017) 'plural projection' framework. In this system, any constituent containing a semantically plural subexpression denotes a set of (possibly higher-type) pluralities. Cumulativity is built into the rules implementing this 'projection' of semantic plurality.},

  abstract = {Universal quantifiers differ in whether they are restricted to distributive interpretations, like English `every', or permit non-distributive interpretations, like English `all'. This interpretative difference correlates with a morpho-syntactic difference: cross-linguistically, distributive universal quantifiers take singular complements, while non-distributive quantifiers take plural complements. Based on the lexical contrast found in languages like English, the interpretational difference is traditionally captured by positing two unrelated lexical entries for distributive and non-distributive quantification, which leaves the correlation between distributivity and the morpho-syntactic number of the complement unexplained. In contrast, we propose a single lexical meaning for the universal quantifier that derives this correlation. Support comes from several unrelated languages that express distributive and non-distributive quantification using the same lexical item, with the interpretation determined by the number of the complement. For languages like English that have different expressions for non-distributive and distributive quantification, we propose that the distributive forms contain an additional morphosyntactic element that is semantically restricted to combine with a predicate of atomic individuals. This is motivated by the fact that in several languages, the form used in distributive quantification is structurally more complex than the non-distributive form and sometimes even contains it transparently.},

  abstract = {In many languages of the world, the focus of a sentence—roughly, information that is new and not presupposed—must be displaced from its thematic position to another position within the clause. In many respects, this displacement resembles the movement of wh-words, also common in many of the world's languages. This dissertation investigates these phenomena, focusing especially on their behavior in San Martín Peras Mixtec. With novel data gathered through linguistic fieldwork, the dissertation addresses a series of questions that have been debated for many years within the linguistics literature: What motivates the displacement of foci? What is the formal relationship between the displacement of foci and the displacement of wh-words? What restrictions ought to be placed on the set of formal features that trigger movement? In this dissertation, I advance the hypothesis that all syntactic movement of foci and wh-words happens indirectly. Specifically, I propose that a set of Alternative Particles—particles that take scope over elements that generate semantic alternatives—can be attracted in the syntax, moving foci and wh-words with them. Consequently, many syntactic similarities between wh-words and foci can be explained by the fact that they both must appear in the scope of Alternative Particles. However, I also present evidence from San Martín Peras Mixtec that demonstrates two clear ways that the movements of wh-words and foci are not formally identical: (i) wh-words, but not foci, move within fronted constituents; (ii) wh-words must move across more local foci when they co-occur within the same clause. I propose that these differences are explained, respectively, in the following ways: (i) wh-words, as a lexical class, can bear a formal syntactic feature that triggers their movement independent of Q Particles. Foci, which do not form a lexical class, do not bear a formal feature; (ii) Q particles bear a superset of the features borne by other Alternative Particles. In addition, I advance a theory of syntactic probing that leverages this distinct featural representation of Q Particles to account for the non-local movement of wh-words.},

The finiteness preference in Mandarin complementation also aligns with ICH: Proposition com-plements only select finite clauses while Event complements are non-finite. Situation complements mostly choose the non-finite version, but some cases can or must choose the finite form. The complements to the left on the ICH are always ‘equally or more finite’ than those to the right.},

We refer to this as the quexistential-focus biconditional. The article makes two contributions. The first is that we offer a possible explanation for one direction of the biconditional: the fact that quexistentials are generally contrastively focused on their interrogative use. We argue that this should be seen as a particular instance of an even more general fact—namely, that interrogative words (quexistential or not) are always contrastively focused—and propose an account for this fact. The second contribution of the article concerns the other direction of the biconditional. We present evidence that, at least at face value, suggests that focus on a quexistential does not necessarily preclude an existential interpretation. Specifically, we show that it is possible for Dutch wat to be interpreted existentially even when it is focused. We attempt to explain this phenomenon.},

Recent work, however, has proposed that plurals are associated with a core existential semantics, and that universal inferences are introduced external to the predication as a grammatical implicature (e.g. Magri 2014, Bar-Lev 2018, 2020, Chatain 2022). We provide new support for the implicature view by establishing that cumulativity patterns like an implicature in the way it interacts with the focus operator only. When only occurs with a scalar term, implicatures are in general observed just in the presupposition, and we show that cumulativity is likewise observed just as presuppositional in only data. While the data follow for free from the implicature analysis, the predicate analysis does not directly predict the observed readings.},

  abstract = {Bu¨ring and Hartmann (2001) provide evidence that when the German exclusive particle nur linearly precedes a sentence-initial fronted DP that reconstructs, it cannot reconstruct along with the DP. They conclude with Jacobs (1983) that nur is always a propositional operator on the clausal spine. However, Smeets and Wagner (2018) show that nur can take reconstructed scope after all, and defend an analysis where nur+DP may be parsed together as a single quantifier.

Dayal (1996) proposed that uniqueness is triggered by an answer operator (ANS), which occurs highest in the question LF, outside the question nucleus. We observe data which we take to show that uniqueness may be triggered at a low scope site, beneath operators which themselves are within the question nucleus. In response to these “low uniqueness” cases, we remove the uniqueness presupposition from ANS, and suggest re-localizing it to the wh itself, which can reconstruct into the question nucleus to take narrow scope. This paves the way for a weakening of ANS previously suggested in Fox 2013 to accommodate mention-some questions.},

  abstract = {Unlike adults, children as old as 9 years of age often fail to infer that a sentence like, ‘Some of the children slept’ implies the falsity of its stronger alternative, ‘All of the children slept’—an inference referred to as a ‘scalar implicature’. Several explanations have been proposed to account for children’s failures with scalar implicature, including domain-general processing limitations, pragmatic deficits or an inability to access the relevant alternatives in a lexical scale (e.g. all as an alternative to some ). Our study focused on the role of Gricean epistemic reasoning in children’s failures by testing their ability to compute ‘ignorance implicatures’, which require reasoning about speaker knowledge and informativeness but which differ from scalar implicature with respect to the alternative statements that are involved. We administered two matched tasks to 4- and 5-year-old children: one that assessed their ability to compute ignorance implicatures, and another that assessed their ability to compute scalar implicatures. Five-year-olds successfully computed ignorance implicatures despite failing to compute scalar implicatures, while 4-year-olds failed at both types of inference. These results suggest that 5-year-olds are able to reason about speaker knowledge and informativeness, and thus that it is difficult to explain their deficit with scalar implicature via these factors. We speculate about other possible sources of their difficulties, including processing limits and children’s access to the specific scalar alternatives required by scalar implicature.},

Contexts presented before these sentences manipulated whether words were linguistically focused and whether they were given or new (Experiment 1); focused targets were read more slowly even when they were given, and new targets were read slowly in general. This both replicated earlier results in which slowdowns were found in the reading of focus (Benatar and Clifton, 2014; Birch and Rayner, 1997; Lowder and Gordon, 2015), and demonstrated that focus slowdowns are not reducible to newness. To clarify earlier results in which speed-ups were found on focused words (Birch and Rayner, 2010; Morris and Folk, 1998), contexts manipulated whether contrastive alternatives to focused words were presented with a focus particle (Experiment 2) or in a cleft construction (Experiment 3). Focused targets were read less slowly when a contrastive alternative was present in the context. This effect of contrastive alternatives cannot be reduced to simple semantic associate priming: Contexts also manipulated whether a semantically associated expression was present independently of the presence of a contrastive alternative (Experiment 4). Readers slowed down less when an alternative was present in the context, even when this alternative was not semantically associated to the target. These results indicate that the processing of focus depends on contrastive alternatives, in their interaction with newness, semantic association, and focus construction.},

These include cases with double negation, bathroom-disjunctions, and modal subordination, which have previously received disparate analyses. Classic dynamic approaches (Kamp 1981, Heim 1982, Groenendijk \&amp; Stokhof 1991) miss the generalization that anaphora is possible whenever the antecedent referent exists in the local context, and they encounter a look-ahead problem. While no previous account addresses both issues, this work resolves them in a unified way. Building on analyses of modal subordination (Stone 1999, Brasoveanu 2006), the paper introduces a flat-update dynamic semantics, where expressions with the potential to introduce a discourse referent do so globally, regardless of their embedding context. Constraints on anaphora are derived based on discourse consistency and a pronominal existential inference interpreted relative to possible worlds in the local context. The analysis uses intensional representations of discourse referents, which store information about their embedding context, and its relationship to speaker commitments, explaining constraints imposed by negation and other nonveridical operators in terms of presuppositions about discourse referents.

The three languages exhibit parametric variation as to whether focusing requires the overt partitioning into a focused cleft constituent and a background clause with a nominalizer (Mandarin) or not (Japanese, Burmese). A major finding is that syntactic partitioning is brought about in two different ways in the languages under discussion: Base-generated clefts (Japanese, Burmese) vs. movement clefts (Japanese, Mandarin). Semantically, cleft structures come with an exhaustive interpretation in all three languages. We hypothesize that, crosslinguistically, syntactic partitioning is a necessary, though not a sufficient condition for exhaustiveness effects with focus.

We rebut these objections, and argue that our plural view is superior to alternative reductive proposals which would identify social groups with the sets or fusions of their members.

  abstract = {Lalo Yi presents a distribution of numeral-classifier pairs that appears to be the complete inverse of the norm found in other numeral-classifier languages. With many numerically-quantified, discourse-new referents, Lalo Yi permits only the use of a floated pattern, and it is not possible to combine numerals and classifiers with NPs as in other numeral-classifier languages. This patterning presents a clear challenge to the oft-adopted assumption that floating quantifiers are derived from non-floated forms by applications of movement (stranding), and potentially favors a base-generation/adverbial approach. A broader consideration of Lalo Yi, however, leads to the proposal that the occurrence of the floating pattern results from a combination of two occurrences of movement—DP movement to a low focus position/FocP, followed by NP-raising to a higher case position. Obligatory stranding of the DP remnant containing numeral-classifier pairs is suggested to result from the FocP being a (low) criterial position in the sense of Rizzi (in: Cheng and Corver (eds) Wh-movement: moving on, MIT Press, Cambridge, pp 97–134, 2006), requiring freezing-realization of the DP in SpecFocP but permitting sub-extraction of NP to satisfy case requirements licensed by a higher functional head. Quite generally, it is suggested that the paradigm in Lalo Yi demonstrates the grammaticalization of an optional tendency found elsewhere in numeral-classifier languages to use special forms for the specific and non-specific indefinite interpretations of numerically-quantified nominals. Additionally, the paper contributes to the growing description and typology of low focus phenomena across languages and observations of variation in the ways that focus may be realized in different languages.},

We propose that comprehenders establish contrastive alternatives by using selection mechanisms that distinguish contrastive from non-contrastive candidates. To examine this proposal, we investigated the time course of contrastive alternatives in two cross-modal priming experiments, manipulating contrastive focus on prime words and the contrastiveness of visual targets. Experiment 1 examined early processing where comprehenders are entertaining candidates for contrastive alternatives. Experiment 2 examined later processing where comprehenders have selected contrastive alternatives from the candidate set. Results demonstrated that when primes were contrastively focused, initially both contrastive and non-contrastive associates were facilitated, but, in subsequent processing, non-contrastive associates became deactivated while contrastive associates maintained facilitation. We argue that selection mechanisms distinguish contrastive from non-contrastive candidates by deactivating non-contrastive candidates, enabling comprehenders to draw proper inferences about speakers’ implicit meanings.},

The focus of the paper is a particular construction in Greek. As always, however, the search for the solution of a particular question reveals many other questions in the process and this paper should be seen as being also about a number of related puzzles in English and other languages.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on an experimental investigation of the scope of English a indefinites and a certain indefinites. Three experiments test whether native English speakers allow indefinites to scope out of syntactic islands, and to take intermediate as well as widest scope. The experimental findings indicate that a indefinites and a certain indefinites have different ranges of interpretations available to them. Experiment 1 shows that a certain indefinites, unlike a indefinites, cannot be interpreted in the scope of an intensional operator, and further shows that functional readings are available to a certain indefinites but not to a indefinites. Experiment 2 focuses on the availability of long-distance readings of indefinites out of scope islands, and shows that the most accessible reading for a certain indefinites is the widest-scope reading, while the most accessible reading for a indefinites is the narrow-scope reading. Experiment 3 shows that modification of an a indefinite by a relative clause does not facilitate long-distance readings, as long as it does not restrict the domain to a singleton set. Overall, these findings are consistent with the proposal of Schwarz (Proceedings of the Thirteenth Amsterdam Colloquium, ILCC, University of Amsterdam, 192–197, 2001) that a certain indefinites and a indefinites are derived by different semantic mechanisms. The behavior of a certain indefinites is shown to be consistent with the contextually determined choice function approach Kratzer (Events in grammar, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 165–196, 1998) and the singleton indefinite approach Schwarzschild (J Semant 19:289–314, 2002). In contrast, a indefinites are most compatible with a purely quantificational approach, contra much recent theoretical literature. These findings highlight the value of conducting experimental studies testing the predictions of semantic theories.},

I argue that the fast contour is the default tempo of MAT and that it brings about a biased interpretation. Slowing down the movement occurs when the feature [slow] is added: the semantic contribution of this feature is to add the presupposition that the question is resolved in the conversational context, resulting in the rhetorical interpretation of the question.},

We show that in a positive-only sentence, the prejacent is a conversational implicature and therefore it is cancellable. Instead, in a negative-only sentence the prejacent is shown to be entailed by any context that satisfies the conditional presupposition and to which the (negative) assertion is added. Hence, the prejacent of a negative-only sentence is not cancellable. The entailment analyses, the strong presupposition analyses and the weak presupposition analyses of only are discussed, together with the problems that each type of theories faces.},

First, I show that in cases of temporal mismatch, [past] cannot be interpreted inside the proposition where it occurs at surface structure. Instead, it must be interpreted as constraining the time argument of the accessibility relation. This has the effect of shifting the time of the evaluation of the conditional to some contextually salient past time. Second, I will propose specific felicity conditions (presuppositions) for subjunctive conditionals and I will argue that there is a strict correspondence between the time of evaluation in the truth conditions of a conditional and the time relevant for the felicity conditions. In other words, if the time relevant for the accessibility relation has been shifted to the past, then the conditional's presupposition will make reference to a past context. On the other hand, if no past is constraining the time argument of the accessibility relation, the conditional's felicity will make reference to the current (main) context. Third, I will argue that the intuition that the antecedent of mismatched counterfactuals is not true is a scalar implicature arising from a competition not between assertions but between presuppositions. Finally, I will investigate the repercussions of my proposal for the general theory of modality.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is a study of modality and, in particular, of conditional statements within the framework of possible world semantics. I argue that in order to understand what the meaning of a modal sentence is we need to look closely at the internal composition of accessibility relations. Accessibility relations are shown to be complex relations involving both a world and a time of evaluation, and it is shown that temporal and aspectual operators can be interpreted in the modal domain, and may not occur inside the scope of the modal operator. When interpreted in this position, temporal and aspectual operators contribute to the selection of the possible worlds by defining the relevant notion of accessibility. Capitalizing on work by Irene Heim, David Lewis and Robert Stalnaker, I show that this proposal allows us to develop a semantic analysis of those conditionals that are traditionally called subjunctive conditionals, and to provide an answer to how to select the worlds that the modal operator quantifies' over. Finally, I argue that the semantic analyses of counterfactuals discussed by Lewis (1979) - Analysis 1 and Analysis 2 - cannot be maintained in that neither of them accounts for the contrast between the felicity conditions of different types of subjunctive conditionals. Instead, I will argue that our theory based on a time-dependent notion of accessibility can.},

The paper’s main goal is to account for Sobel sequences of conditionals and sequences of disjunctive sentences, but I will also propose that this analysis can be extended to sequences of sentences with superlatives. The starting point is the observation that, while all these sequences are felicitous in one order, they are infelicitous when the order is reversed. Previous proposals have focussed on particular types of infelicitous sequences (e.g. von Fintel, in: Kenstowicz (ed) Ken Hale: A life in language, MIT Press, Cambridge, 2001; Moss in Noûs 46:516–586, 2012; Lewis in Noûs 52:481–507, 2018; a.o.), or a subset of all the phenomena cited above (e.g. Singh in On competition between only and exh, 2008b; Linguist Philos 31:245–260, 2008c; Dohrn, in: Pistoia-Reda, Domaneschi (eds) Linguistic and psycholinguistic approaches on implicatures and presuppositions. Palgrave McMillan, Basingstoke, 2017; a.o.). I propose that sequences of sentences belonging to the same structured set of alternatives T are subject to a Specificity Constraint (SC): sequences are acceptable if both alternatives are dominated by the same number of nodes in the structured set of alternatives T. Violations of SC can be avoided by strengthening the weaker alternative. However, covert strengthening violates an economy condition if the overtly stronger alternative is among those made salient by the preceding utterance in the sequence (if any). I propose that the set of alternatives made salient by an utterance of a sentence s consists of s’s sisters and mother in T. I will show that the strengthening mechanism varies depending on the kind of sequence we have.},

The paper provides one more argument for a grammatical theory of ignorance along the lines of ( 7).},

  abstract = {This dissertation explores the role of scalar implicatures in the grammar of plurality and disjunction. I argue that scalar implicatures are relevant not only for the meaning of plurals and disjunctions, but also for their distribution in language. For example, the computation of scalar implicatures will be shown to be the decisive factor regulating the patterns of (un)grammaticality of plural agreement with disjunctive noun phrases (Chapter 3). But before getting to conclusions like that, I will spend some time on the semantics of bare plurals (Chapter 2), developing a version of the grammatical view of scalar implicatures along the way (some necessary background on scalar implicatures will be built in Chapter 1). The claim that scalar implicatures are calculated in the grammar is very far from uncontroversial. But if they really are, then many of the facts that I discuss could be predicted, more or less straightforwardly. If one treats scalar implicature calculation as a purely pragmatic process, these facts are arguably harder to make sense of.},

  abstract = {Negative Polarity Items (NPIs) with emphatic prosody such as ANY or EVER, and minimizers such as lift a finger or sleep a wink are known to generate particular contextual inferences that are absent in the case of non-emphatic NPIs such as unstressed any or ever. It remains an open question, however, what the exact status of these inferences is and how they come about. In this paper, we analyze these cases as NPIs bearing focus, and examine the interaction between focus semantics and the lexical semantics of NPIs across statements and questions. In the process, we refine and expand the empirical landscape by demonstrating that focused NPIs give rise to a variety of apparently heterogeneous contextual inferences, including domain widening in statements and inferences of negative bias in questions. These inferences are further shown to be modulated in subtle ways depending on the specific clause-type in which the NPI occurs (e.g., polar questions vs. wh-questions) and the type of emphatic NPI involved (e.g., ANY vs. lift a finger). Building on these empirical observations, we propose a unified account of NPIs which posits a single core semantic operator, even, across both focused and unfocused NPIs. What plays a central role in our account is the additive component of even, which we formulate in such a way that it applies uniformly across statements and questions. This additive component of even, intuitively paraphrased as the implication that all salient focus alternatives of the prejacent of the operator must be settled in the doxastic state of the speaker, is selectively activated depending on the presence of focus alternatives, and is shown to be able to derive all the observed contextual inferences stemming from focused NPIs, both in statements and in questions.},

There has been significant disagreement in the literature regarding which type of wh-phrases gives rise to intervention, as well as which one among the c-commanding scopal operators is an intervener. There are competing empirical claims in the literature, which have to this day not been subject to experimental evaluation. The results of our study show that wh-nominals and wh-adverbials exhibit a similar pattern of degraded acceptability. Our results further show a clear distinction between why and other wh-phrases, favoring Ko’s (2005) idea that a separate, why-induced scope effect is disentangled from the garden-variety case of wh-intervention.},

I present a novel empirical generalization, in which it is shown that the ability for quantifiers to induce intervention hinges upon their monotonicity and their ability to be interpreted as topics. I then propose a semantic account of intervention that correlates topicality with the monotone properties of intervening operators. A crucial assumption in this account is that why-questions in Chinese are idiosyncratic, in that the Chinese equivalent of why directly merges at a high scope position that stays above a propositional argument. Combining the semantic idiosyncrasies of why-questions with the theory of topicality, I conclude that a wide range of intervention phenomena can be explained in terms of interpretation failure.},

Pragmatic theories attempt to save logic. A semantic theory of human reasoning is founded on mental models of possibilities. “Or” refers to a conjunction of possibilities that each hold in default of knowledge to the contrary. A disjunction: it is permissible to do A or to do B, yields a deontic interpretation of the possibilities, and elicits mental models of a conjunction of default permissions. They yield or-deletions, such as: therefore, it’s permissible to do A. The theory predicts the paradoxes and new phenomena, which four experiments corroborated. For example, exclusive disjunctions such as: Few of the artists are brutalists or else cubists, have an intuitive model that yields or-deletions, but deliberation can construct models that refute them.},

  abstract = {The view that definite noun phrases are systematically accompanied by uniqueness implications is defended in this dissertation against rivals and counterexamples, with emphasis on the precise understanding of the phenomenon and factors which have obscured its generality. It is argued that all definites are 'unique', in a sense defined within the Kamp/Heim framework on the basis of discourse representations containing implicated, accommodated and contextually supplied material. Definites are contrasted with indefinites, including indefinites with numeral determiners. In quantified sentences, a definite may be unique relative to another element. For example, the use of the definite pronoun in Every chess set comes with a spare pawn. It is taped to the top of the box implies that there is a unique spare pawn per chess set. It is argued that uniqueness depends on the configuration of quantifiers and their scope; roughly, a definite A is unique relative to an element B if it has narrow scope relative to B. A general theory of uniqueness is proposed, and applied to a variety of examples. Then the 'asymmetric' reading of quantified sentences is discussed; that is, for example, the reading of Most women who have a dog are happy which is false in the situation where out of ten women, one has 50 dogs and is happy, and the other nine have exactly one dog each and are miserable. The asymmetric reading is not captured by the unselective quantification found in the Kamp/Heim system. An analysis of this reading is proposed, which finds support in the behavior of definite NPs in 'donkey' sentences, and which derives a cluster of properties of the reading from the asymmetry inherent to scope relations. Thus both uniqueness and the asymmetric reading are seen to reflect scope relations. The combined understanding and analyses of these phenomena are shown to reveal and explain systematic patterns in the behavior of donkey sentences, and illuminate puzzling speakers' judgements concerning these sentences.},

His solution involves specifying a trivalent inquisitive semantics for (coordinations of) questions that bakes the various asymmetries of presupposition projection into the lexical entry of conjunction/disjunction. However, we argue that such a move faces both theoretical and empirical issues. Instead, we show that the data can be handled without moving to such an asymmetric inquisitive denotation, by adapting the novel pragmatic theory of Limited Symmetry (Kalomoiros in Proceedings of the 52nd annual meeting of the North East linguistic society, GLSA, Amherst, 2022) to an inquisitive framework in a way that leaves the underlying semantics for conjunction symmetric and bivalent, while deriving the projection data.},

  abstract = {A core issue in presupposition theory concerns the potential role of linear order for projection. This paper presents experimental evidence that conjunction and disjunction differ precisely in this regard. Presuppositions project asymmetrically from conjunction: a presupposition in the first conjunct projects regardless of any information in the second conjunct that could be used to satisfy the presupposition, while a presupposition in the second conjunct can be ‘filtered’ by material in the first, so that it doesn’t project. We find no such asymmetry for disjunction, where presuppositions in both the first and the second disjunct can be filtered by information in the other disjunct. Theoretically, these results pose a challenge to traditional dynamic accounts, and also strongly argue against accounts that take all projection and filtering to be uniformly determined by linear order across connectives. Instead, they call for an account of projection that can differentiate between conjunction and disjunction by modulating the effects of linear order through proper consideration of the underlying truth conditions of each connective.},

  abstract = {Much recent research has recognized the importance of focus and contrastive topic in assertions for discourse coherence. However, with few exceptions, it has been neglected that focus and contrastive topic also occur in questions, and have a similar role in establishing coherence. We propose a framework of dynamic interpretation based on the notion of Commitment Spaces that show that a uniform interpretation of focus and contrastive topic is possible. The algebraic representation format is rich enough so that a separate introduction of discourse trees is not necessary. The paper discusses these phenomena for Turkish, a language with an explicit focus marker for polar and alternative questions, which distinguishes focus from contrastive topic.},

The correlation is different from what has been observed in the literature in that it concerns not only right monotonicity, but also left monotonicity (persistence/antipersistence). I claim that the reading selected by a donkey sentence with a double monotone determiner is in fact the one that validates inference based on the left monotonicity of the determiner. This accounts for the lack of strong reading in donkey sentences with \textasciitilde "MON 1' determiners, which have been neglected in the literature. 2[ consider the relevance of other natural forms of inference as well, but also suggest how monotonicity inference might play a central role in the actual process of interpretation. The formal theory is couched in dynamic predicate logic with generalized quantifiers.},

Aspectual verbs like stop were discussed already by Greek philosophers, proper names, Kepler, and definite descriptions, the present king of France, go back to Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell by the turn of the century. Just in the span of a few years my generation of semanticists assembled a veritable zoo of "presupposition triggers" under the assumption that they were all of the same species. Generations of students have learned about presuppositions from Stephen Levinson's 1983 book on Pragmatics that contains a list of 13 types of presupposition triggers, an excerpt of an even longer unpublished list attributed to a certain Lauri Karttunen. My task in this presentation is to come clean and show why the items on Levinson's list should not have been lumped together. In retrospect it is strange that the early writings about presupposition by linguists and even by philosophers like Robert Stalnaker or Scott Soames do not make any reference to the rich palette of semantic relations they could have learned from Frege and later from Paul Grice. If we had known Frege's concepts of Andeutung~ – Grice's conventional implicature~ – and Nebengedanke, it would have been easy to see that there are types of author commitment that are neither entailments nor presuppositions.},

In~a first, more conservative version, the redundancy is specific to disjunctions. In a second, more~general version, redundancy is banned regardless of constituent type. Both versions make new~predictions about the emergence of oddness in cases that are not covered by Hurford’s Constraint.~The first version is too restricted. The second one is incorrect. We explore a revised architecture~in which the relevant redundancy principle applies locally in the semantic computation. This~perspective makes different predictions about oddness than the first two and has a potentially interesting~extension to oddness in quantificational constructions, which we discuss.

According to a common view, these alternatives are generated by a permissive process. This permissive view has been challenged by Michael Wagner, who has noted that certain alternatives are systematically excluded from consideration. Wagner describes a more restrictive view, on which only contrastive alternatives are relevant for association with focus and for the appropriateness of focus in discourse. I use recent work on the role of contradiction to show that the standard, permissive view derives the same results as the contrast-based view for the basic cases. These basic cases involve a contradiction that prevents us from using them to distinguish the two approaches. I show that when this contradiction is eliminated, evidence of non-contrastive alternatives emerges, supporting the permissive standard view over the restrictive contrast-based one.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of focus to context has often been analyzed in terms of focus-based anaphoric relations between sentences and surrounding discourse. The literature, however, has also noted empirical difficulties for the anaphoric approach, and my goal in the present paper is to investigate what happens if we abandon the anaphoric view altogether. Instead of anaphoric felicity conditions, I propose that focus leads to infelicity only indirectly, when the semantic processes that it feeds—in particular, exhaustification and question formation—make an inappropriate contribution to discourse. I~outline such an account, in line with Roberts (In Papers in semantics, Vol. 49 of Working papers in linguistics, 91–136, The Ohio State University, 1996) and incorporating recent insights from Büring (In Questions in discourse, Vol. 36 of Current research in the semantics/pragmatics interface, 6–44, Leiden: Brill, 2019) and Fox (In Proceedings of Sinn und Bedeutung 22, 403–434, 2019). This account, which I motivate on conceptual grounds, has no anaphoric conditions on focus placement and has only an economy condition as a potential felicity condition on focus. However, there are cases where the fine control offered by anaphoricity seems needed, either to block deaccenting that would be licensed by a question or to allow local deaccenting that is not warranted by a question. Such cases challenge non-anaphoric accounts such as the present one and appear to support recent anaphoric proposals such as Schwarzschild (In Making worlds accessible. Essays in honor of Angelika Kratzer, 167–192, 2020), Wagner (In The Wiley Blackwell companion to semantics, Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2020), and Goodhue (Journal of Semantics 39: 117–158, 2022). I~argue that this potential motivation for anaphoricity is only apparent and that to the extent that anaphoric conditions on focus from the literature are not inert, they are in fact harmful.},

The speaker didn’t, so we conclude that John doesn’t.

I provide new data that pose a challenge to the use of monotonicity and that support the structure-sensitive definition.

I then focus on Richard Jeffrey’s ’random-variable’ approach, which circumvents these problems by giving up the notion that conditionals denote propositions in the usual sense. Even so, however, the random-variable approach makes counterintuitive predictions in simple cases of embedded conditionals. I propose to address this problem by enriching the model with an explicit representation of causal dependencies. The addition of such causal information not only remedies the shortcomings of Jeffrey’s conditional, but also opens up the possibility of a uni?ed probabilistic account of indicative and counterfactual conditionals.},

Syntactically, this variant behaves like a noun and is typically modified by a sentence (or a suitable proform). The resulting NP ‘S-tokoro’ roughly means ‘time at which S’. With the copula ‘da/datta’ (Nonpast/Past) it can form a matrix sentence; but on its own it can also be used as a temporal adverbial. In these respects it is similar to other temporal expressions like ‘S-mae’ (‘time before S’), ‘S-ato’ (‘time after S), and ‘S-toki’ (‘time at which S’). But the acceptability and interpretation of ‘S-tokoro’ interacts with the temporal and aspectual properties of ‘S’ in puzzling ways. Focusing on matrix uses in this paper (embedded ones being similar), we develop an analysis that accounts for those interactions.},

  abstract = {Intensional operators are often treated as quantifiers over possible worlds, parallel to the treatment of determiners as quantifiers over individuals. Individuals introduced in intensional contexts cannot serve as antecedents to later pronouns as easily as those introduced in (merely) quantificational contexts, though. For instance, a quantified sentence like Everyone is eating a cheeseburger may be felicitously followed by an anaphoric statement like They are large, where they refers to the totality of cheeseburgers being eaten. However, as Stone (1999) points out, the quite similar Andrea might be eating a cheeseburger does not support later anaphoric references such as It is large or They are large. Stone (1999), Stone \&amp; Hardt (1999), and Brasoveanu (2010) solve this problem by restricting the value of pronouns: in their systems, a pronoun presupposes that its referent(s) exist in the world of evaluation, ruling out anaphora from non-veridical intensional contexts. And yet, we show in this paper (i)~cases where such anaphora is disallowed even when the pronoun’s referents clearly exist and (ii)~cases where such anaphora is indeed allowed, even though the pronoun’s referents might not exist. We argue instead that intensional anaphora is best captured using a description-based, rather than a value-based account. We propose that a pronoun presupposes that its corresponding antecedent description is instantiated in each world of the context set. For instance, there must be a cheeseburger being eaten by Andrea in every candidate world of the context set in order for It is large to be felicitous after Andrea might be eating a cheeseburger. We implement our proposal via a new logic (building on work by Keshet 2018, Abney \&amp; Keshet 2022) that we name Plural Intensional Presuppositional predicate calculus (or PIP). Each PIP formula translates directly into standard first-order predicate calculus with set abstraction, providing a classical foundation for this work. BibTeX info},

In this paper, I discuss four observations about coordinated if-clauses, and motivate a semantics for conditionals that reorients the compositional structure of the restrictor theory. On my proposal, if-clauses provide restrictions on modal domains, but they do so by way of a higher type intermediary—a set of propositions—that is collapsed by the modal. I argue that combining this view with an independently plausible type-shifting operation applied to or and and predicts the range of data we find for conditionals with coordinated if-clauses.},

  abstract = {Inquiry into the meaning of logical terms in natural language (‘and’, ‘or’, ‘not’, ‘if’) has generally proceeded along two dimensions. On the one hand, semantic theories aim to predict native speaker intuitions about the natural language sentences involving those logical terms. On the other hand, logical theories explore the formal properties of the translations of those terms into formal languages. Sometimes these two lines of inquiry appear to be in tension: for instance, our best logical investigation into conditional connectives may show that there is no conditional operator that has all the properties native speaker intuitions suggest ‘if’ has.Indicative conditionals have famously been the source of one such tension, ever since the triviality proofs of both Lewis (1976) and Gibbard (1981) established conclusions which are prima facie in tension with ordinary judgements about natural language indicative conditionals. In a recent series of papers, Branden Fitelson (2013, 2015, 2016) has strengthened both triviality results, revealing a common culprit: a logical schema known as import-export. Fitelson's results focus the tension between the logical results and ordinary judgements, since import-export seems to be supported by intuitions about natural language. In this paper, we argue that the intuitions which have been taken to support import-export are really evidence for a closely related but subtly different principle. We show that the two principles are independent by showing how, given a standard assumption about the conditional operator in the formal language in which import-export is stated, many existing theories of indicative conditionals validate one but not the other. Moreover, we argue that once we clearly distinguish these principles, we can use propositional anaphora to show that import-export is in fact not valid for natural language indicative conditionals (given this assumption about the formal conditional operator).This gives us a principled and independently motivated way of rejecting a crucial premiss in many triviality results, while still making sense of the speaker intuitions which appeared to motivate that premiss. We suggest that this strategy has broad application and teaches an important lesson: in theorizing about the logic of natural language, we must pay careful attention to the translation between formal languages, in which logical results are typically proved, and natural languages, which are the subject matter of semantic theory.},

I argue that the property which defines the perfect in absolute tense systems is the dissociation of the temporal location of the situation from the reference point from which it is viewed (i.e. R ≠ E). The analytical problems posed hitherto by the English Perfect are due to the fact that it neutralises the distinction between E {$<$} R and R {$<$} E. Although the semantic dimension of the perfect emerges from the system of temporal meanings, alternatively the perfect could be viewed as a category expressing meanings between canonical tense and canonical aspect, overlapping both.},

  abstract = {What is conveyed by a sentence frequently depends not only on the descriptive content carried by its words, but also on implicit alternatives determined by the context of use. Four visual world eye-tracking experiments examined how alternatives are generated based on aspects of the discourse context and used in interpreting sentences containing the focus operators only and also. Experiment 1 builds on previous reading time studies showing that the interpretations of only sentences are constrained by alternatives explicitly mentioned in the preceding discourse, providing fine-grained time course information about the expectations triggered by only. Experiments 2 and 3 show that, in the absence of explicitly mentioned alternatives, lexical and situation-based categories evoked by the context are possible sources of alternatives. While Experiments 1–3 all demonstrate the discourse dependence of alternatives, only explicit mention triggered expectations about alternatives that were specific to sentences with only. By comparing only with also, Experiment 4 begins to disentangle expectations linked to the meanings of specific operators from those generalizable to the class of focus-sensitive operators. Together, these findings show that the interpretation of sentences with focus operators draws on both dedicated mechanisms for introducing alternatives into the discourse context and general mechanisms associated with discourse processing.},

It is a less familiar point that switching the order of the generics has deleterious effects on their felicity. For example, the sequences ‘Ravens are black, but albino ravens aren’t’ is perfectly felicitous and judged to be true, whereas its reverse ‘Albino ravens aren’t black, but ravens are’ is infelicitous and contradictory-sounding. This paper argues that such sequences pose a problem for extant theories of generics: while they have no trouble predicting the felicity of the first sequence of generics, they are unable to explain why reversing the order results in infelicity. I propose to account for these observations by adopting a dynamic semantic theory of generic sentences.},

Thus speakers must use classifiers after numerals and demonstratives to semantically partition all nouns: count concepts must be counted with a classifier (一架钢琴, one FRAME piano) the way English mass nouns are (one GLASS OF water). While an ontological distinction is not apparent in Chinese nouns, some have argued that this information might be encoded at the classifier level and that classifiers might play a functional role similar to that of gender-marked determiners. In order to better understand the role massifiers and classifiers play in language comprehension, three visual world experiments were conducted. Phonological cohort competition and anticipatory eye-movements were examined in cases of English mass reference, Chinese count reference, and Chinese mass reference. Results suggest that classifiers are interpreted structurally and have an immediate impact on referential selection, and this effect is potentially stronger with massifiers and mass referents.},

I argue that these are only apparent cases of split scope and, building on Murray (2008) and Dotlačil (2012), I propose a decompositional account of reciprocals which is formalized in Champollion, Bledin \&amp; Li's (2017) Plural Predicate Logic, a static logic which makes use of sets of assignment functions to model plurals. The resulting analysis allows us to view SRs and reciprocal pronouns like each other as being built from the same pieces, with the only difference between them being in how they are syntactically built.},

We show that their proposal overgenerates on two accounts. Firstly, it predicts too weak a presupposition for modalized interrogatives. Secondly, it predicts unattested interpretations for interrogatives containing negation. We show that both issues can be solved using exhaustification operators. On the one hand, we obtain the desired presupposition for modalized interrogatives by assuming the lexical trigger for uniqueness to be a presuppositional variant of an exhaustification operator (Bassi, Del Pinal \&amp; Sauerland 2019). On the other, we show that unattested readings of negation can be blocked by assuming that questions presuppose that the pointwise exhaustification of their answers partitions the context of evaluation (Fox 2019). We argue that proper empirical coverage for singular wh-interrogatives requires the interaction of both exhaustification operations.},

We explain this finding in terms of semantic accounts of ellipsis licensing, where ellipsis is licensed when the sluice corresponds to an (implicit) question under discussion. We show that QUDs cannot be computed from the truth-conditional content of the antecedents alone; instead, they must be computed only after (scalar) implicatures have been calculated and added to the common ground, along with the context of utterance. We further discuss the commitments required of syntactic/LF identity accounts of ellipsis licensing in order to accommodate multiple sluicing with quantified antecedents, and argue that such accounts are practically untenable.},

Cross-linguistically, wh-words are commonly used not only for question formation but also in a range of other constructions, including wh-quantification, indefinites, and the formation of relative clauses. In Chuj, we will show that wh-words are used to form indefinites (in certain limited environments), universal quantifiers, free choice items, and two kinds of free relatives: definite free relatives, but also the typologically rarer indefinite free relatives. We sketch an analysis of each construction, and discuss generalizations concerning their distribution.

  abstract = {Classical Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) predicts that an indefinite noun phrase cannot antecede an anaphoric element if the noun phrase is, but the anaphoric element is not, in the scope of a negation; the theory also predicts that no anaphoric links are possible between the two parts of a disjunction. However, it is well known that these predictions meet with counterexamples. In particular, anaphora is often possible if a double negation intervenes between antecedent and anaphoric element, and also if the antecedent not only occurs in the first part of a disjunction but also within the scope of a negation, while the anaphoric element is in the second part of the same disjunction. In this paper we argue that these recalcitrant phenomena are related and that a solution to the double negation problem will also provide us with a solution to the disjunction problem. We review the basic set-up of classical DRT and offer an extension (called ‘Double Negation DRT’) which validates the law of double negation An adaptation of the standard DRT construction algorithm which transforms texts into Discourse Representation Structures is sketched and it is shown that the problems with negation and disjunction that led to the definition of our new version of DRT are properly dealt with},

It agrees with earlier assessments that a complete conditional (with antecedent and consequent) is embedded under a quantifier in those constructions, but then proceeds to create a dilemma by showing that we can’t always find the right interpretation for that conditional. Contrary to earlier assessments, Stalnaker’s conditional won’t always do. The chapter concludes that the embedded conditional in the sentence above is a material implication, but the               if               -clause also plays a pragmatic role in restricting the domain of the embedding quantifier. That an appeal to pragmatics should be necessary at all goes with Edgington’s verdict that ‘we do not have a satisfactory general account of sentences with conditional constituents’.},

We motivate two features, [FoC] and [G], and we track the fate of those features at and beyond the syntax-semantics and the syntax-phonology interfaces. [FoC] and [G] are responsible for two distinct obligatory strategies for establishing discourse coherence. A [G]-marked constituent signals a match with a discourse referent, whereas a [FoC]-marked constituent invokes alternatives and thereby signals a contrast. In Standard American and British English [FoC] aims for highest prosodic prominence in the intonational phrase, whereas [G] lacks phrase-level prosodic properties. There is no grammatical marking of newness: The apparent prosodic effects of newness are the result of default prosody.},

I've tried publishing a version of this paper in a couple of logic journals, but it was considered too linguistic (which is obvious), but I don't wish to publish in a linguistics journal--my frustration with the field, and its Chomsky cult, should be evident in this paper.] Abstract: In this paper I argue that conjunction does not adhere to minimalist principles because NP conjunction is a set of potentially ‘equal’ elements that may, or may not, be interpreted as collective.  As a concatenation of individual elements (interpreted either plurally or collectively singular), NP conjunction fulfills a logical role, not a semantic one, so neither projects relations nor receives agree features as words with ‘special content’ do.  This leads to a grammatical problem which parallels the Truth Problem in philosophical logic.  While norms and conventions are easily and predictably abstracted and interpreted from simple constructions, the interpretation of semantic features such as number and gender within a conjunction appears to add a level of uncertainty and complexity that results in varied coordination systems among the world’s languages. This ‘issue’ is solved if we accept that semantics—that is, meaning-- drives syntax and that the structures we use to communicate are the basic structures of logic utilized across the cognitive spectrum. Thus, I propose that a foundational logic, or protologic, allows natural human language syntax and rather than being generative, syntax is itself generated by logical relations among concepts.},

Second, this paper defines and discusses the notions of Focus (as indicating alternatives) and its various uses, Givenness (as indicating that a denotation is already present in the CG), and Topic (as specifying what a statement is about). It also proposes a new notion, Delimitation, which comprises contrastive topics and frame setters, and indicates that the current conversational move does not entirely satisfy the local communicative needs. It also points out that rhetorical structuring partly belongs to IS.},

  abstract = {Plural definite descriptions across many languages display two well-known properties. First, they can give rise to so-called non-maximal readings, in the sense that they ‘allow for exceptions’ (Mary read the books on the reading list, in some contexts, can be judged true even if Mary didn’t read all the books on the reading list). Second, while they tend to have a quasi-universal quantificational force in affirmative sentences (‘quasi-universal’ rather than simply ‘universal’ due to the possibility of exceptions we have just mentioned), they tend to be interpreted existentially in the scope of negation (a property often referred to as homogeneity, cf. Löbner in Linguist Philos 23:213–308, 2000). Building on previous works (in particular Krifka in Proceedings of SALT VI, Cornell University, pp 136–153, 1996 and Malamud in Semant Pragmat, 5:1–28, 2012), we offer a theory in which sentences containing plural definite expressions trigger a family of possible interpretations, and where general principles of language use account for their interpretation in various contexts and syntactic environments. Our theory solves a number of problems that these previous works encounter, and has broader empirical coverage in that it offers a precise analysis for sentences that display complex interactions between plural definites, quantifiers and bound variables, as well as for cases involving non-distributive predicates. The resulting proposal is briefly compared with an alternative proposal by Križ (Aspects of homogeneity in the semantics of natural language, University of Vienna, 2015), which has similar coverage but is based on a very different architecture and sometimes makes subtly different predictions.},

We study the projection property of homogeneity by deploying methods of general interest to identify truth-value gaps. Method A consists in collecting both truth judgments (completely true vs. not completely true) and, independently, falsity judgments (completely false vs. not completely false). The second method, employed in experiment series B and C, is based on one-shot ternary judgments: completely true vs. completely false vs. neither. After a calibration of these methods, we use them to demonstrate that homogeneity projects out of negation, the scope of universal sentences and the scope of non-monotonic quantifiers such as exactly two, to some extent (i.e., in two out of three conceivable kinds of gap situations). We assess our results in light of different theoretical approaches to homogeneity—approaches based on presuppositions, scalar implicatures, and something like supervaluations, respectively. We identify free parameters in these theories and assess various variants of them based on our results. Our experimental paradigms may be of broader significance insofar as they can be applied to other phenomena which result in the failure of a sentence to have a definite truth value.},

The account combines two assumptions: the assumption that permission is rule-abiding performance in some contextually relevant situations; and the assumption that the contextually relevant situations are picked out by the mechanism that selects the possible worlds relevant for the evaluation of counterfactual conditionals. The account explains the non-monotonicity of permissions and solves a puzzle, raised by Timothy Williamson, about the seeming failure of permissions to distribute over conjunction. In the domain of epistemic norms, the account solves an analogous puzzle and deals successfully with so-called blindspot propositions.},

We argue that the phenomenon is primarily controlled by a ban against extracting the focus of negation (irrespective of its referentiality and argument/adjunct status) out of the scope of the negative element, and by a pragmatic factor that bans questions that solicit uninformative answers.},

We examined whether inthese cases, too, alternatives are represented by testing for an interference effectof the particle only, which necessarily evokes alternatives. Using the probe recog-nition task, we first tested unmentioned alternatives to the constituent parts ofVPs, to object nouns (Experiment 1, letter for manuscript) and verbs (Experiment 2,wrote for read). In Experiment 3, we tested alternatives to the whole phrase (wrotethe letter). In all experiments, alternative probes were processed slower thanunrelated ones. We found varying evidence of the interference effects of only with noun,verb and whole-phrase alternatives. Overall, this study does not provide supportfor the generalisation of the effects of only to larger units. Since our study was thefirst to use the probe recognition task with phrase-sized constituents, we discussthe methodological implications of our work – we found a relatedness effect forwhole phrases and this shows that the probe recognition task can be used to testthe representation of larger constituents.},

It is noted that NPIs in this language are composed of a (weak) indefinite plus a particle bhii meaning ‘even’. It is argued that the compositional semantics of this combination explains their behavior as NPIs as well as their behavior as free choice (FC) items. I assume that weak Hindi indefinites like ek and koi are to be viewed as a predicate that I call one, a predicate that is true of everything that exists. I further assume that bhii exhibits association with focus with the indefinite, and that this leads to contradictory implicatures in positive contexts. The behavior of these phrases in a variety of syntactic contexts is discussed, including constructions like correlatives. Finally, I provide a comparison with analyses of English any, and discuss the relevance of the analysis presented here for that of any.},

Standard counterexamples, including tense, de se attitudes, and knowledge ascriptions, all admit of alternative analyses which do not make use of such parameters. Moreover, allowing such indices greatly complicates the task of defining disagreement, and forces an odd separation between what is true, and what someone has truthfully said. If non-world indices are always fixed by the context of assessment, a characterization of semantic theories as ‘relativist’ in terms of assessment-sensitivity converges with a characterization in terms of sensitivity to non-world indices. More tentatively, I suggest that even a possible world index, when used in the assignment of truth-values to sentence contents, should be fixed by the context of assessment, not the context of use. This eliminates MacFarlane's category of ‘non-indexical contextualism’, and results in a system in which parameters fixed by the context of use are used only in the assignment of contents to linguistic expressions, and parameters used in the assignment of truth-values to contents are uniformly fixed by the context of assessment.},

However, converging evidence from recent work on modality and from other areas of cognitive science suggests that epistemic states are better thought of as having the richer structure of probability distributions. I describe an account of semantic and pragmatic presupposition which combines core ideas from dynamic semantic treatments with a probabilistic model of information states and their dynamics in conversation, and argue that it predicts the core data of the proviso problem (Geurts 1996) without invoking ad hoc mechanisms as conditional strengthening accounts typically do. The frequently cited intuition that (ir)relevance is crucial follows without stipulation, and I present new cases which suggest that irrelevance is too weak to predict all cases of unconditional presuppositions, problematizing strengthening accounts which rely on it. The proposed theory is able to account for this new data and also for semi-conditional presuppositions, a sticking point for previous theories of presupposition projection. I argue that this perspective also gives us a reasonable line on several related issues, including the divergence between presupposed conditionals and conditional presuppositions, instances of the proviso problem in counterfactuals, and the contextual variation in the difficulty of accommodation. http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp.5.2 BibTeX info},

The goal of this paper is to reduce these selectional requirements to a single requirement of monotonic growth of measurement in relation to the ‘size’ of distributivity. More concretely, it is argued that binominal each imposes a constraint on the functional dependencies arising from distributive quantification, requiring that the measurement of its host grows monotonically with the number of values being distributively quantified. To make constraints on dependencies formally explicit, I devise a version of dynamic plural logic with features from van den Berg (1996) and Brasoveanu (2008, 2013) to semantically represent dependencies arising from evaluating distributive quantification. The use of a dynamic logic, coupled with a delayed evaluation mechanism in terms of higher order meaning (Cresti, 1995; Swart, 2000; Charlow, 2021, allows the constraint to act as an output context constraint on distributive quantification, which mirrors the use of output constraints pioneered by Farkas (1997, 2002b) and and further developed in Brasoveanu (2013), Henderson (2014) and Kuhn (2017).},

Presuppositional implicatures, as I call them, arise when a speaker uses a presuppositionally weak alternative when a presuppositionally stronger alternative was available. My goal is to give a detailed, working theory of presuppositional implicatures, and show that they are a special case of scalar implicatures. In doing so, I carefully contrast presuppositional implicatures with antipresuppositions. These two phenomena have been treated as closely related in the literature, but some differences have not been adequately appreciated. Antipresuppositions are observed when a presuppositionally weak alternative is infelicitously used in a context that satisfies the presupposition of a presuppositionally stronger alternative. Presuppositional implicatures arise when a presuppositionally weak alternative is felicitously used in a context that does not satisfy the presupposition of a presuppositionally stronger alternative, but where that stronger presupposition would have been accommodated. Attention to this difference reveals a shortcoming in Schlenker’s (Nat Lang Semant 20:391–429, 2012) theory of presuppositional implicature. This paper both identifies and remedies that shortcoming.},

Four major types of meaning for the particle are identified - depreciatory, restrictive, specificatory and emphatic. The discussion concerns itself with the nature of the relationship between these categories. The fact that the categories shade into one another suggests that a semantic model of the traditional type, identifying a number of distinct variants of just, is inadequate. An analysis of these data lends support rather to a model of semantic interpretation of the kind recently proposed by Moore and Carling (1982), in which meaning emerges from the complex interplay between a particular linguistic element and other semantic entities in the structure. Particular attention is paid to the interaction between just, tense, perfect aspect and progressive aspect. Following Moore and Carling (1982) a principle of `modulation' is proposed, involving the concept' of ‘marginal phase’, in order to account for the relationship between the various readings.},

  abstract = {[A revised version of this manuscript is published here: https://benjamins.com/catalog/la.283] Displacement (of linguistic expressions) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural language. In the generative tradition, displacement is modelled in terms of transformation, or more precisely, movement, which establishes dependencies among syntactic constituents in a phrase structure. This thesis probes the question regarding to what extent movement theories can be unified. Specifically, I ad- dress issues surrounding the debate of the distinction between head movement and phrasal movement over the past few decades. The distinction presupposes that structural complexity of the moving el- ement is correlated with its movement properties. The goal of this thesis is to show that this is an unwarranted assumption. Based on a number of case studies on verb displacement phenomena in Cantonese, I attempt a unified theory of movement by abandoning the head/phrase distinction in movement theories. Particularly, I show (i) that verbs in Cantonese can undergo syntactic move- ment to the peripheral position of a sentence and is subject to general locality/minimality constraints on movement, and (ii) that their movement may affect semantic interpretation, leading to discourse effects and scope effects that are commonly observed in phrasal movement. I further argue, with evi- dence from linearization, that head movement and phrasal movement in Cantonese are subject to the same mechanism when determining the pronunciation of the movement chains. These observations converge on the conclusion that the phrase structure status of syntactic constituents bears a minimal role in theorizing displacement phenomena in natural language. This thesis represents a minimalist pursuit of a unified theory of movement.},

  abstract = {We show that the interpretation of sentences like John is not very Adj depends on whether Adj is vague. We argue that this follows from a constraint on the interaction between vagueness and conversational implicature, a domain that has not been studied extensively. The constraint states that implicatures are not drawn if they lead to “borderline contradictions” (see Ripley 2011; Alxatib \&amp; Pelletier 2011; a.o.), a natural extension of the idea that implicatures should not contradict assertions (Hackl 2006; Fox 2007; a.o.). Experiment 1 establishes that not very Adj gives rise to the implicature Adj for the non-vague absolute adjective late, but not for the vague relative adjective tall (in the terminology of Kennedy \&amp; McNally 2005a). Experiment 2 generalizes this result to three relative adjectives in the positive form (tall, hot, fast), against those same adjectives in their (non-vague) comparative forms (taller/hotter/faster than the average X). We also constructed quantitative meaning representations for complex predicates of the form Adj \$ \textbackslash wedge \textbackslash neg \$very Adj, using fuzzy logic to model the contribution of boolean connectives and our experimental data to represent the meanings of adjectives. The results of these analyses suggest that strengthening not very Adj with Adj leads to a more contradictory interpretation when Adj is vague than when it is not, as expected on our theory. While our results apply directly to only a specific set of lexical items, we hypothesize that they reflect a more general pattern among gradable predicates. This motivates more systematic investigation into the role that vagueness can play in the derivation of conversational implicatures.},

But reverse a sequence like this one and it no longer sounds so good, which is surprising on the classic semantics. This observation motivated Kai von Fintel (2001) and Thony Gillies (2007) to propose dynamic semantic accounts of counterfactual conditionals. Subsequently, Sarah Moss (2012) defended the classic semantics against the charge that it need be abandoned in the face of these order effects, arguing that the infelicity of the reverse sequences is pragmatic. I argue that both accounts are ultimately untenable, but each account has strengths. Seeing what works and what doesn't in each account points the way to the right positive view. With this in mind, I defend a contextualist account of counterfactuals that takes conversational relevance to play a central role.},

  abstract = {This work investigates the non-interrogative uses of Chinese wh-phrases as a path to understand the design of wh-phrases in general. Chinese wh-phrases can appear in veridical contexts and receive a universal interpretation, only when they associate with the marker dou. When they are bare wh-phrases (i.e. not in association with dou), their non-interrogative uses only have existential meanings, and the uses are subject to a non-veridicality condition, a widespread property of non-interrogative uses of bare wh-phrases crosslinguistically. The behavior of Chinese wh-phrases is a reminiscent of English any. Any has similar peculiar restrictive distribution. It conditionally appears in veridical contexts with a universal reading, as in John picked any flower *(on the ground). And its other uses are subject to a non-veridicality condition, like its use as a negative polarity item in negative sentences or as a Free Choice item in modalized sentences (e.g. you may pick any flower). Therefore it is tempting to try a polarity-based analysis for the non-interrogative uses of Chinese wh-phrases. This is the line taken in the present dissertation. It argues for the application of a unified framework for both the polarity system and the Chinese wh-system. Specifically, it shows how Chierchia's bi-dimensional alternative-based framework for polarity items can be extended to Chinese wh-phrases. To apply the framework, the thesis assumes that Chinese wh-words can function like Free Choice items. That is, it follows Karttunen (1977) in assuming that wh-words are existentially quantified. Then it adds the idea that Chinese wh-words can activate subdomain and scalar alternatives. When they activate alternatives, they call for a recursive process of exhaustification. The process derives different readings in different contexts, and results in a semantic clash in some cases, enabling us to explain the non-veridical condition mentioned above. This thesis also discusses some differences between Chinese wh-phrases and other polarity items. It explicitly illustrates how the approach accounts for the differences in a single parameterized mechanism through slight modification or a switch. To summarize, the approach gives us an overall simple analysis of the Chinese wh-system and the whole polarity system, and the mechanism displays a strong explanatory strength in explaining complicated empirical facts in a systematic way.},

The relation between the non-interrogative Wh and its licensor is a binder-variable relation, like the one that exists between an interrogative Wh and a question operator. Appropriate interpretations of given Wh-elements are determined by the property of the binder: if a Wh-element is bound by a question operator, it is an interrogative; if bound by a non-question operator, it is a non-interrogative.

The goal of this paper is to provide a formal account of the gradability of the “you\,+\,NP” construction. We show that the gradability of this construction is conditioned by the NP inside: when the NP inside denotes abstract substances (e.g., wisdom), “you\,+\,NP” is gradable; if NPs denote non-abstract substances (e.g., apples and water), “you\,+\,NP” is non-gradable. Abstract and non-abstract NPs differ in the types of measure scales they are associated with: abstract NPs are associated with a scale that lacks an absolute zero point (i.e., an ordinal or an interval scale), and non-abstract NPs are associated with a scale that contains such a point (i.e., a ratio scale). The semantics of the existential/possessive morpheme you is sensitive to this distinction and gives rise to variation in gradability.},

However,there are diversified views regarding how intermediate scope readings should be dealt withand which level(s) existential closure should apply to. This paper attempts to make acontribution to this debate by examining existential polarity wh-phrases in Chinese. I showthat unlike the behaviors of polarity indefinites in St'át'imcets reported by Matthewson(1999), intermediate scope readings are possible for polarity wh-phrases in Chinese but aresubject to some locality conditions. I suggest that implicit arguments of choice functionsmight have a parametric value the choice of which affects availability of intermediate readings.The findings in this paper thus revive the possibility, rejected by Matthewson (1999), that thechoice function mechanism may vary from language to language or from indefinite NPs in onelanguage to indefinite NPs in another language or even from one type of indefiniteNP to another type of indefinite NP within the same language.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the learnability of English indefinite any, Dutch modal verb hoeven, and Mandarin Chinese (WH-)indefinite/pronoun shenme. These three expressions, belonging to different syntactic categories in different languages, have been referred to as Negative Polarity Items (NPIs) in the literature, as they are all restricted to contexts that in some sense count as negative although there are differences in the types of semantic environment that may license them. By investigating the distribution of these three expressions in both child and child-directed speech recorded in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney 2009), this paper argues that children in their acquisition of these NPIs employ the same conservative widening learning strategy (Berwick and Weinberg 1986; Manzini and Wexler 1987), which prevents them from overgeneration. A two-stage acquisition process is detected for each of the three NPIs. However, distinct learning pathways are found, which we take as evidence indicating different underlying analyses of these expressions at different stages in child language. Taking into consideration the input characteristics, the distributional patterns of the three expressions in adult grammar, and the children’s lexical development, we hypothesize what the analyses of any, hoeven, and shenme at different acquisition stages look like. This provides us with a different view of the nature, or the reason underlying the restricted distribution of these expressions in adult language.},

The difficulties of giving a compositional interpretation to constructions of these kinds are discussed in detail. I show that we can solve those difficulties if we treat dou as a generalized distributivity marker in the sense of Schwarzschild (1991, 1996), which distributes over the members of a plurality cover. Apart from the above topic, which is more narrowly a semantics topic, this paper also discusses some syntax-semantics interface issues related to the distribution of dou's associates.},

  abstract = {It is known that a multiple-wh question can inquire about a dependency between wh-expressions, termed ‘wh-dependency’, admitting a pair-list answer. In discourse, the dependency can even support a ‘plural’ interpretation of a singular pronoun. Consider Which\_u girl bought whichν book and how much did she\_u pay for it\_ν?. The multiple-wh question is asking about a dependency between girls and books. In the subsequent question, the dependency is referred to and the resolution of the singular pronouns varies among the girls and the books they bought. While van Rooy (1998) and Dotlačil \& Roelofsen (2019) have noticed this phenomenon, it is still understudied. Based on their insights, this paper argues that reference to wh-dependencies is facilitated in two types of subordination constructions—quantificational subordination, where reference to wh-dependencies is facilitated through quantificational structure, and question subordination, where reference to wh-dependencies is facilitated through con- joining questions. Building on Hamblin-Karttunen semantics of questions and Dynamic Plural Logic, this paper proposes a dynamic family-of-questions approach to multiple-wh questions. In particular, a multiple-wh question generates a set of sub-questions, i.e., a family of questions, and then the set is transformed into a set of possible pair-list answers. Both encode the relevant wh-dependency in a different manner. As a consequence, the dependency encoded in a family of questions is retrievable in question subordination, while the one encoded in a pair-list answer is retrievable in quantificational subordination.},

In the analysis, universal force is derived from exhaustification of the subdomain alternatives activated by wh-items under stress, and the tendency of wh-ye to appear in negative sentences is explained by the interaction between ye and domain widening. Specifically, the ye in wh-ye is argued to be a scalar ye imposing a total order presupposition on its associated set of alternatives. In wh-ye it associates with the domain argument of the wh, and the requirement can be met by either an ordered wh or a two-point scale \$\textbackslash langle D',D \textbackslash rangle \$made available through domain widening, specifically by widening of QUDs. The negative preference follows from the fact that a QUD is most naturally widened when it is settled negatively, as in the case of negatively biased questions with minimizers/maximizers.},

  abstract = {Mandarin universal terms such as mei-NPs in preverbal positions usually require the presence of dou ‘all/even’. This motivates the widely accepted idea from Lin (Nat Lang Semant 6:201–243, 1998) that Mandarin does not have genuine distributive universal quantifiers, and mei-NPs are disguised plural definites, which thus need dou—a distributive operator (or an adverbial universal quantifier in Lee (Studies on Quantification in Chinese. Ph. D. thesis, UCLA), Pan (in: Yufa Yanjiu Yu Tansuo [Grammatical Study and Research], vol 13, pp 163-184. The Commercial Press)—to form a universal statement. This paper defends the opposite view that mei-NPs are true universal quantifiers while dou is not. Dou is truth-conditionally vacuous but carries a presupposition that its prejacent is the strongest among its alternatives (Liu in Linguist Philos 40(1):61–95, 2017b). The extra presupposition triggers Maximize Presupposition (Heim in: Semantik: Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgenssischen Forschung, pp 487-535. de Gruyter, Berlin, 1991), which requires [dou S] block [S] whenever dou’s presupposition is satisfied. This explains the mei-dou co-occurrence, if mei-NPs are universal quantifiers normally triggering individual alternatives (thus stronger than all the other alternatives). The proposal predicts a more nuanced distribution of obligatory-dou, not limited to universals and sensitive to discourse contexts.},

I urge you (to finish drinking) a cup of wine’ and shuru gan jie wu duanchu (竖儒敢揭吾短处) ‘how dare the Confucius scholar uncover my demerits’) have provided structural templates for the formation of Modern Chinese PPO constructions. They also have led to a condition in which there are more examples of a maleficiary Modern Chinese PPO construction than examples of a beneficiary Modern Chinese PPO construction (e.g. ta chi le wo de doufu (他吃了我的豆腐) ‘he has taken advantage of me’ vs. ta shuo le wo de haohua (他说了我的好话) ‘he has put in a good word for me’). The grammaticalization pathway can also explain the formation of other constructions including another Modern Chinese PPO construction (e.g. ta chi le wo de kui (他吃了我的亏) ‘he has suffered the loss caused by me’), a Modern Chinese pseudo-object construction (e.g. wo ganxie ni de haoxin (我感谢你的好心) ‘I thank you for your kindness’), and a Modern Chinese pseudo-modifier construction (e.g. wo pa le yi xiawu de shan (我爬了一下午的山) ‘I did mountain-climbing for the whole afternoon’).},

In this theory, intuitive models (system 1) do not represent what is false, and so produce errors in estimates of p(if A then C), yielding instead p(A \& C). Deliberative models (system 2) are normative, and yield the proportion of cases of A in which C holds, i.e., the Equation. Intuitive estimates of the probability of a conditional about unique events: If covid-19 disappears in the USA, then Biden will run for a second term, together with those of each of its clauses, are liable to yield joint probability distributions that sum to over 100\%. The error, which is inconsistent with the probability calculus, is massive when participants estimate the joint probabilities of conditionals with each of the different possibilities to which they refer.

  abstract = {An important motivation for Montague’s work on quantification (Montague 1974) was to achieve uniformity with respect to referential and quantificational subjects. This was attained by type raising all NPs to denote sets of sets (indeed there are claims that such a move is theoretically necessary) and by giving up a subject–predicate semantics where the verbal predicate predicates of the nominal argument. In this paper we argue for essentially the opposite move whereby all predication is genuine predication and involves arguments -- witnesses of type individual or set of individuals (for plurals). We argue that such an approach is crucial if one is to capture a variety of fundamentally important phenomena involving anaphora, clarification interaction, and speech-gesture cross-references associated with the use of quantificational noun phrases in dialogue, and to explicate several recent psycholinguistic key results on quantifier processing -- all features of an NP semantics which give rise to what we call “Referential Transparency”. The discussion is couched in a new set-denotational framework for plural count nouns, namely sets of ordered set bipartitions. We argue that quantification happens entirely within the noun phrase and involves ref(erence)sets, comp(lement)sets, and max(imal)sets. As a corollary of this denotational foundation, the semantic conservativity universal is an immediate consequence and the range of quantifier denotations is significantly reduced. In addition to collecting empirical motivation for quantification from Referential Transparency Theory and to developing a count noun semantics, a theoretically grounded explanation for complement set anaphora is given.

We argue that (i) the indefinite/definite asymmetry can be explained away if we assume that mei is a distributive quantifier with a portmanteau semantic structure, i.e., that it is a standard universal quantifier plus a matching function; (ii) mei can be domain-shifted into a distributive determiner to satisfy interpretability, and this explains the subject/object asymmetry and (iii) this domain-shifting is regulated by the Principle of Economy (cf. Reinhart (2006)), which is a last resort to satisfy interpretability.},

  abstract = {This thesis aims to account for the interpretative differences between the sentence final particles (SFPs) le and de in Mandarin Chinese and provide an analysis that captures their syntactic properties. Along with Shen (2004)‟s analysis, which categorized le as a [+dynamic] particle, I propose that de is [-dynamic], which needs to agree with the closest predicate in dynamicity. This analysis suggests that all the predicates in Mandarin Chinese are [+dynamic] by default. As a result, I re-define the function of dynamic light verbs proposed in Shen (2004). I argue that dynamic light verbs do not need to serve the function of inchoativity; instead, they provide the extent change on common grounds. Semantically, le and de can both signify the change of common grounds, while de has more restrictions on privateness and accessibility of information, as proposed in Soh (2018). Alternate abstract: 本研究旨在解釋漢語中句末助詞「了」和「的」之間的語意及句法差異。Shen (2004) 的分析提到，「了」帶有 [+dynamic] 的屬性，須與句子中最接近的謂詞一致; 我認為「的」則帶有 [-dynamic] 的屬性，也須與最接近的謂詞一致化。此分析 也顯示，漢語中的所有謂詞都是預設 [+dynamic] 的屬性。此研究亦重新定義了 Shen (2004) 提出的動態輕動詞的功能，認為動態輕動詞的功能並非使謂詞語意 含有啟動意義 (inchoativity)，而是讓加上程度副詞後形成 [-dynamic] 的謂語詞 組可以在說話者與聽話者共同資訊基礎上做程度的變化。在語意上，「了」和「的」 都可以表示說話者與聽話者共同資訊基礎的變化，而如 Soh (2018) 所提出的， 此研究亦顯示「的」對訊息的隱私性和可取得性有更多限制。},

If this proposal is on the right track, then oddness can be used as a diagnostic for scalar implicatures. In this paper, I use this diagnostic to provide one more argument that scalar implicatures are computed not only at the matrix level but also in embedded position. The argument is based on a puzzling pattern of oddness in downward entailing environments. Some apparently unrelated facts about restrictions on temporal modification with individual-level predicates are shown to fit into the pattern. http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp.4.6 BibTeX info},

Schlenker (Nat Lang Semant 20(4):391–429, 2012, sections 3 and 4) objects that contextual Blindness is too strong an assumption because of the contextually ordered alternatives documented in Hirschberg (A theory of scalar implicature. Garland, New York, 1991). He thus submits that the computation of scalar implicatures is not blind but just contextually “short-sighted”: it can ignore certain pieces of common knowledge, but it is not required to ignore all of it. In this chapter, the author shows that Schlenker’s proposal is a technical mistake: Short-sightedness is provably equivalent to Blindness under natural assumptions on the set of scalar alternatives. Short-sightedness thus provides no new ammunition against Hirschberg’s challenge. The author then takes a closer look at the challenge, through some initial evidence, that contextually ordered alternatives are restricted and dependent on specific lexical choices. He conjectures that these choices share the property of introducing more logical structure than meets the eye, thus possibly providing the logical ordering required by Blindness (or the equivalent Short-sightedness). If this conjecture turns out to be correct, contextual ordering is never relevant to scalar implicatures, as indeed predicted by Blindness (or the equivalent Short-sightedness).},

This squib looks at variants of these sentences where the main predicate is modified through conjunction in the scope of an existential quantifier, such as \# Some Italians come from a warm country and are blond . These sentences are shown to raise two puzzles for a theory of oddness based on mismatching scalar implicatures. The first puzzle is that these variants sound odd despite the fact that no independently justifiable scalar alternative is able to trigger the mismatch. The second puzzle is that their oddness is sensitive to certain manipulations in the preceding discourse, violating the crucial assumption that mismatching implicatures are blind to context. The two puzzles are left unsolved.},

  abstract = {Davidsonian event semantics has an impressive track record as a framework for natural language analysis. In recent years it has become popular to assume that not only action verbs but predicates of all sorts have an additional event argument. Yet, this hypothesis is not without controversy in particular with respect to the particularly challenging case of statives. Maienborn (2003, 2005b) argues that there is a need for distinguishing two kinds of states. While verbs such as sit, stand, sleep refer to eventualities in the sense of Davidson (= Davidsonian states), the states denoted by such Stative verbs like know, weigh, and own, as well as any combination of copula plus predicate are of a different ontological type (= Kimian states). Against this background, the present study assesses the two main arguments that have been raised in favour of a Davidsonian approach for statives. These are the combination with certain manner adverbials and Parsons’ (2000) so-called time travel argument. It will be argued that the manner data which, at first sight, seem to provide evidence for a Davidsonian approach to statives are better analysed as non-compositional reinterpretations triggered by the lack of a regular Davidsonian event argument. As for Parsons’s time travel argument, it turns out that the original version does not supply the kind of support for the Davidsonian approach that Parsons supposed. However, properly adapted, the time travel argument may provide additional evidence for the need of reifying the denotatum of statives, as suggested by the assumption of Kimian states.},

After criticizing existing approaches—the existential quantificational analysis, the universal quantificational analysis, and the conditional analysis—it presents a new account that builds on both the existential and conditional analyses. On this account, the act conditional analysis, a sentence like ‘John can swim across the river’ says that there is some practically available action (in a sense the essay makes precise) that is such that if John tries to do it, he swims across the river. The essay argues that the act conditional analysis avoids the problems faced by existing accounts of agentive modality and shows how the act conditional analysis can be extended to an account of generic agentive modal claims. The upshot is a new vantage point on the role of agentive modal ascriptions in practical discourse: ability ascriptions serve as a kind of hypothetical guarantee, and compulsion ascriptions as a kind of nonhypothetical guarantee.},

A variety of approaches have been developed to account for those differences. All approaches agree that both Moore sentences and Wittgenstein sentences are classically consistent. In this article I argue against this consensus. I adduce a variety of data that I argue can best be accounted for if we treat Wittgenstein sentences as being classically inconsistent. This creates a puzzle, since there is decisive reason to think that ⌜Might p⌝ is consistent with ⌜Not p⌝. How can it also be that ⌜Might p and not p⌝ and ⌜Not p and might p⌝ are inconsistent? To make sense of this situation, I propose a new theory of epistemic modals that aims to account for their subtle embedding behavior and shed new light on the dynamics of information in natural language.},

I avoid these problems by adopting two changes in perspective on presupposition. First, I propose a theory of projection according to which presuppositions project unless they are locally entailed. Second, I reject the standard assumption that presuppositions are contents which must be entailed by the input context; instead, I propose that presuppositions are contents which are marked as backgrounded. I show that, together, these commitments allow us to avoid the proviso problem altogether, and generally make plausible predictions about presupposition projection out of connectives and attitude predicates. I close by sketching a two-dimensional implementation of my theory which allows us to make further welcome predictions about attitude predicates and quantifiers.},

  abstract = {Is the mechanism behind presupposition projection and filtering fundamentally asymmetric or symmetric? This is a foundational question for the theory of presupposition which has been at the centre of attention in recent literature (Schlenker in Theor Linguist 38(3):287–316, 2008b. https://doi.org/10.1515/THLI.2008.021, Semant Pragmat 2(3):1–78, 2009. https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.2.3; Rothschild in Semant Pragmat 4(3):1–43, 2011/2015. https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.4.3 a.o.). It also bears on broader issues concerning the source of asymmetries observed in natural language: are these simply rooted in superficial asymmetries of language use (language use happens in time, which we experience as fundamentally asymmetric); or are they, at least in part, directly encoded in linguistic knowledge and representations? In this paper we aim to make progress on these questions by exploring presupposition projection across conjunction, which has traditionally been taken as a central piece of evidence that presupposition filtering is asymmetric in general. As a number of authors have recently pointed out, however, the evidence which has typically been used to support this conclusion is muddied by independent issues concerning redundancy; additional concerns have to do with the possibility of local accommodation. We report on a series of experiments, building on previous work by Chemla and Schlenker (Nat Lang Semant 20(2):177–226, 2012. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11050-012-9080-7) and Schwarz (in: Schwarz (ed) Experimental perspectives on presuppositions, Springer, Cham, 2015), using inference and acceptability tasks, which aim to control for both of these potential confounds. In our results, we find strong evidence for left-to-right filtering across conjunctions, but no evidence for right-to-left filtering—even when right-to-left filtering would, if available, rescue an otherwise unacceptable sentence. These results suggest that presupposition filtering across conjunction is asymmetric, contra suggestions in the recent literature (Schlenker in Theor Linguist 34(3):157–212, 2008a. https://doi.org/10.1515/THLI.2008.013, 2009 a.o.), and pave the way for the investigation of further questions about the nature of this asymmetry and presupposition projection more generally. Our results also have broader implications for the study of presupposition: we find important differences in the verdicts of acceptability versus inference tasks in testing for projected content, which has both methodological ramifications for the question of how to distinguish presupposed content, and theoretical repercussions for understanding the nature of projection and presuppositions more generally.},

Indefinites have been relatively neglected by philosophers, under the Russellian assumption that they are simply existential quantifiers. However, a robust set of patterns suggest that this assumption is wrong. In this paper I develop a new approach to (in)definites which aims to capture these patterns. On my theory, truth-conditions are classical. But in addition to truth-conditions, meanings comprise a second dimension, which I call bounds. It is at the level of bounds, not truth-conditions, that the characteristic coordination between indefinites and definites takes place. My system has a classical logic, thus avoiding serious problems which face the most plausible extant account of these patterns, namely, dynamic semantics. More generally, my approach yields a new perspective on the relation between truth-conditions and dynamic effects in natural language.},

This phenomenon is called ‘actuality entailment’. We show that actuality entailments arise with goal-oriented modality only and endorse Belnap’s view of that goal-oriented modals use historical accessibility with a fixed past and an open future. This modal-theoretic assumption allows us to spell out the precise modal-temporal configuration in which the actuality entailment arises and our predictions are borne out by the data, cross-linguistically. We also show that, when any assumption about the identity of worlds at branching point is leveled - which appears to be the case with generic deontic and opportunity modals, the actuality entailments disappear. We also predict that the entailment disappears with prospectivity. Finally, we argue that modal sentences giving rise to actuality entailments are informative, insofar as the contribution of the modality survives as a presupposition that the modal base is non-homogeneous.},

These problems disappear as soon as the structure of exclusive plural DPs contains a component that generates exclusive-plural interpretations, either Harbour’s [−atomic] feature (added to a system with a second, [−atomic]-less structure, a proposal compatible with, e.g., Farkas and de Swart 2010) or a predicate-level exhaustivity operator (from Mayr 2015).},

We present 6 additional experiments (for a total of 10) designed to probe the effect of those task features on sensitivity, both independently and in combination. Our results suggest three notable conclusions: (i) there is a clear advantage to joint presentation of theoretically-related sentence types, regardless of the type of response scale used in the experiment; (ii) tasks involving a continuous slider (which have an infinite number of response options, and few labels) offer good sensitivity, while relying solely on spatial reasoning rather than numeric reasoning; and (iii) there are a number of subtle interactions among the three task features that may warrant further investigation. We discuss the potential benefits and concerns of each of these features in detail, along with the relevance of these findings for deciding how to investigate both simple and higher-order acceptability contrasts.},

  abstract = {Disjunctive sentences like June visited Frankfurt or Düsseldorf are com- monly understood as conveying that June didn’t visit both cities (exclusivity), and that the speaker doesn’t know which of the two cities June visited (ignorance). There is a general consensus that these inferences arise as scalar implicatures. The standard pragmatic approach derives exclusivity and ignorance on the basis of the same assumptions and reasoning about the speaker’s communicative inten- tions. This predicts that these two inferences should pattern together: either both of them are derived by the hearer, or neither of them is. This prediction, however, has recently been challenged: in so-called ‘semi-cooperative’ contexts – contexts where it is presupposed that the speaker won’t provide all relevant information available to them (e.g., game situations) – it has been claimed that exclusivity may arise independently from ignorance (Fox 2014, Agyemang 2020). After reviewing existing evidence in favor of this claim, we report on two experiments testing alternative explanations while also looking at novel, presuppositional sentences (e.g., Bill is not aware that June visited Frankfurt or Düsseldorf), which have been argued to give rise to similar exclusivity and ignorance inferences (Spector \& Sudo 2017, Marty \& Romoli 2021b). Our findings offer further experimental evidence in support of the claim of interest and establish that the challenge in question extends to the presupposition level as well. While the challenge raised by semi-cooperative contexts is real, we argue that it may be overcome by refining the standard pragmatic view and, specifically, by generalising the standard assump- tions underlying the pragmatic derivation of exclusivity and ignorance. The resulting account is shown to explain why ignorance and exclusivity pattern together in normal cooperative contexts, but not in semi-cooperative ones.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental research has observed two kinds of priming effects on quantity implicatures. One is the Strong–Weak contrast, where more quantity implicatures are observed after prime trials forcing interpretations with quantity implicatures (‘Strong primes’) than after prime trials forcing interpretations without quantity implicatures (‘Weak primes’). The other effect is the Alternative-Weak contrast, where prime trials mentioning alternative expressions (‘Alternative primes’) similarly lead to more quantity implicatures. It has been claimed that both of these effects should be understood in terms of increased salience of alternative expressions used to compute quantity implicatures. We present experimental evidence that speaks against this hypothesis. With the help of novel baseline conditions, which were absent in previous studies on implicature priming, we observe that the results in the priming paradigm commonly used in the literature are inverse preference effects in the sense that robust priming effects are observed towards interpretations that are normally unexpected, and depending on the baseline expectation, each of the three prime types mentioned above may have priming effects. We furthermore investigated different types of alternative priming for so-called ad hoc implicatures and found that for these implicatures, presenting an alternative expression in a simple sentence does not have a priming effect on the implicature of a similarly simple sentence, but presenting it in a more complex conjunctive construction does. Our results also show that conjunctions of similar but irrelevant expressions have a similarly robust priming effect and that conjunctive sentences with two conjuncts do not give rise to priming effects on the interpretation of sentences of the same syntactic complexity, but those with three conjuncts do. To make sense of these observations, we propose that what crucially matters for priming implicatures is incremental change in one’s probabilistic expectations about the current conversational context brought about by a process we call context adaptation.},

In the previous literature, these interpretative effects have been subsumed under different generalizations and accounted for by means of different primitive principles (e.g., Minimize Restrictors!, The 'i-within-i' Condition, Maximize Presupposition!). The claim that I put forward in this thesis is twofold. First of all, I show that, upon closer examination, all these phenomena are reducible to the theory of implicatures. Second, I argue that an implicature-based approach to these phenomena offers a better empirical coverage of the relevant effects than previously achieved. Capitalizing on Magri (2009, 2011, 2014, and subsequent works), I will offer a conceptualization of implicature computation on which assertive and pre-suppositional implicatures are derived in grammar, allowing a uniform account of the phenomena of interest.},

  abstract = {Free Choice (FC) is an inference arising from the interaction between existential modals and disjunction. Schematically, a sentence of the form permitted(A or B) gives rise to the inference ◊A∧◊B. Many competing theories of FC have been proposed but they can be classified into two main groups: one group derives FC as an entailment, while the other derives it as an implicature. By contrast, Negative Free Choice (NFC), the corresponding inference from negated universal modals embedding conjunction, e.g., not(required(A and B)) to ¬□A∧□B, has been discussed much less, and its existence has even been questioned in the recent literature. This paper reports on three experiments whose results provide clear evidence that NFC exists as an inference, but also indicate that NFC is far less robust than FC. This leaves us with two theoretical possibilities: the uniform approach, which comes in two versions, one deriving both FC and NFC as implicatures, and the other deriving both as entailments, and the hybrid approach that derives FC as an entailment and NFC as an implicature. We argue that the observed difference between FC and NFC is straightforwardly explained under the hybrid approach while it poses a challenge for the uniform approach. We end with a brief discussion of the options we see for the uniform approach and their further consequences. BibTeX info},

  abstract = {A disjunctive sentence like Olivia took Logic or Algebra conveys that Olivia didn’t take both classes (exclusivity) and that the speaker doesn’t know which of the two classes she took (ignorance). The corresponding sentence with a possibility modal, Olivia can take Logic or Algebra, conveys instead that she can take Logic and that she can take Algebra (free choice). These exclusivity, ignorance and free choice inferences are argued by many to be scalar implicatures. Recent work has looked at cases in which exclusivity and ignorance appear to be computed instead at the presupposition level, independently from the assertion. On the basis of those data, Spector and Sudo (Linguist Philos 40(5):473–517, 2017) have argued for a hybrid account relying on a pragmatic principle for deriving implicatures in the presupposition. In this paper, we observe that a sentence like Noah is unaware that Olivia can take Logic or Algebra has a reading on which free choice appears in the presupposition, but not in the assertion, and we show that deriving this reading is challenging on Spector and Sudo’s (2017) hybrid account. Following the dialectic in Fox (Presupposition and implicature in compositional semantics, Palgrave, London, pp 71–120, 2007), we argue against a pragmatic approach to presupposition-based implicatures on the ground that it is not able to account for presupposed free choice. In addition, we raise a novel challenge for Spector and Sudo’s (2017) account coming from the conflicting presupposed ignorance triggered by sentences like \#Noah is unaware that I have a son or a daughter, which is infelicitous even if it’s not common knowledge whether the speaker has a son or a daughter. More generally, our data reveals a systematic parallelism between the assertion and presupposition levels in terms of exclusivity, ignorance, and free choice. We argue that such parallels call for a unified analysis and we sketch how a grammatical theory of implicatures where meaning strengthening operates in a similar way at both levels (Gajewski and Sharvit in Nat Lang Semant 20(1):31–57, 2012; Magri in A theory of individual-level predicates based on blind mandatory scalar implicatures, MIT dissertation, 2009; Marty in Implicatures in the DP domain, MIT dissertation, 2017) can account for such parallels.},

  abstract = {Maximize Presupposition! (MP), as originally proposed in Heim (Semantik: Ein internationales Handbuch der zeitgenössischen Forschung, pp. 487–535, 1991) and developed in subsequent works, offers an account of the otherwise mysterious unassertability of a variety of sentences. At the core of MP is the idea that speakers are urged to use a sentence ψ over a sentence ϕ if ψ contributes the same new information as ϕ, yet carries a stronger presupposition. While MP has been refined in many ways throughout the years, most (if not all) of its formulations have retained this characterisation of the MP-competition. Recently, however, the empirical adequacy of this characterisation has been questioned in light of certain newly discovered cases that are infelicitous, despite meeting MP-competition conditions. This has led some researchers to broaden the scope of MP, extending it to competition between sentences which are not contextually equivalent (Spector and Sudo in Linguistics and Philosophy 40(5):473–517, 2017) and whose presuppositions are not satisfied in the context (Anvari in Proceedings of Semantics and Linguistic Theory 28, pp. 711–726, 2018; Manuscript, IJN-ENS, 2019). In this paper, we present a body of evidence showing that these formulations of MP are sometimes too liberal, sometimes too restrictive: they overgenerate infelicity for a variety of felicitous cases while leaving the infelicity of minimally different cases unaccounted for. We propose an alternative, implicature-based approach stemming from Magri (PhD dissertation, MIT, 2009), Meyer (PhD dissertation, MIT, 2013), and Marty (PhD dissertation, MIT, 2017), which reintroduces contextual equivalence and presupposition satisfaction in some form through the notion of relevance. This approach is shown to account for the classical and most of the novel cases. Yet some of the latter remain problematic for this approach as well. We end the paper with a systematic comparison of the different approaches to MP and MP-like phenomena, covering both the classical and the novel cases. All in all, the issue of how to properly restrict the competition for MP-like phenomena remains an important challenge for all accounts in the literature.},

  abstract = {According to the Polarity Hypothesis, the presence or absence of a processing cost for Scalar Inferences (SIs) depends on their polarity. This hypothesis predicts, among other things, that the processing of lower-bounding SIs should not be affected by cognitive load the same way upper-bounding SIs are. To date, evidence in support of this prediction comes from the comparison between upper-bounding and lower-bounding SIs elicited by disparate scalar words. In this paper, we report on two dual-task experiments testing this prediction in a more controlled way by comparing upper-bounding and lower-bounding SIs arising from the same scalar words or scale-mates operating over the same dimension. Results show that, for these more minimal comparisons, lower-bounding SIs involve comparable cognitive demands as their upper-bounding counterparts. These findings challenge the idea that load effects are consistently modulated by SI polarity and suggest instead that these effects are relatively consistent across different types of SIs. \&nbsp;},

  abstract = {This paper reports on two experiments investigating the relationship between distributive and negated universal inferences arising from disjunction embedded within a universal quantifier. It has been claimed that distributive inferences can be derived independently from negated universal inferences with nominal, but not with modal quantifiers (Booth 2022, Crnič et al. 2015, Fusco 2015, Sayre-McCord 1986). Experiment 1 tested this claim by comparing cases involving the determiner `every' and cases involving the modal `must', where `must' expressed epistemic necessity. Experiment 2 followed up on Experiment 1 by testing the same two quantifiers, only this time the modal `must' expressed deontic necessity. The results from both experiments show that distributive inferences may arise independently of negated universal inferences with both types of operator. While the findings for `every' essentially replicate those from Crnič et al. 2015, the findings for `must' are new and go against the aforementioned claim. Furthermore, the response time results from both experiments show that distributive inferences are associated with response delay effects in the opposite direction to those generally observed for regular scalar implicatures, raising a new challenge for (some versions of) the implicature-based account of these inferences. We discuss the prospects of non-implicature accounts such as Aloni 2022.},

These constructions have long been observed to give rise to inferences of proper partitivity: upon hearing a sentence like Sue talked to three of John’s lawyers, we spontaneously understand that John has more than three lawyers, that is we interpret the partitive three of John’s lawyers as denoting a proper subset of the denotation of John’s lawyers. Contra the common idea that proper partitivity follows from the plain meaning of partitives, I defend here the view that partitives semantically express partitivity tout court, that is they encode the reflexive ‘part-of’ relation, and that proper partitivity comes about as a result of a presuppositional implicature on the basis of the competition between those indefinite expressions and their non-partitive definite alternatives, e.g., John’s three lawyers.},

  abstract = {The notion of alternatives is one of the most pervasive notions in the modern study of meaning, and different characterisations of this notion have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we focus on two them. The first one sees alternatives as alternative sentences derived through substitution operations. The second sees alternatives as alternative propositions associated with the presence of certain operators. While both these notions have been argued to be central to the derivation of a variety of inferences, it is an open question whether both of them are needed to account for pragmatically enriched meanings. This paper brings a novel perspective on this question by focusing on ignorance inferences coming from disjunctive sentences of varying complexity. We show that the predictions of the two approaches come apart for disjunction embedding conjunction and that only the notion of alternatives as alternative sentences can account for the range of ignorance inferences observed in these environments. We take this result to suggest that tightening alternatives to the presence of specific operators is too constrained of an assumption to adequately capture the distribution of ignorance inferences. We end by discussing a problematic case for the notion of alternatives as alternative sentences and sketch a solution based on formal constraints on alternatives which have been independently argued for in the literature.},

This paper reports on a series of experiments that tested this hypothesis by comparing positive, disjunctive sentences giving rise to the three inference types of inferences to variants of these sentences involving either negation and conjunction, or negation and disjunction, for which the implicature approach predicts similar inferences on the basis of the same type of alternatives. Our results reveal that, while the three inferences are indeed quite robust in the disjunctive cases, regardless of whether negation is present or not, the inferences that their negative, conjunctive variants give rise to are not. These findings are challenging for the idea that the type of alternatives involved in SI computation (i.e., sub-constituent vs. lexical) is a major factor responsible for differences in robustness.

The pluralization of mass nouns is an illusion in that what is being pluralized is a noun that has been singulativized. The chapter shows that Ojibwe has remnants of a gender shift system (much clearer morphologically in Mesqualike (Fox) and that gender shift marks the singulative. That Algonquian languages are singulative languages is a brand new claim that makes many interesting predictions. Theoretically, the chapter integrates singulative systems into Borer's (2005) theory of division and argue that these languages provide another strategy to perform division on nouns that are still undivided.},

  abstract = {The presence of contrastive focus on pronouns interpreted as bound variables is puzzling. Bound variables do not refer, and it is therefore unclear how two of them can be made to contrast with each other. It is argued that this is a problem for both alternative-based accounts such as Rooth’s (Nat Lang Semantics 1:75–116, 1992) and givenness-based ones such as Schwarzschild’s (Nat Lang Semantics 7:141–177, 1999). The present paper shows that previous approaches to this puzzle face an empirical problem, namely the co-occurrence of additive too and focus on bound pronouns. Our account is based on the idea that the alternatives introduced by focused bound pronouns denote individuals. Putting forward the novel concept of compositional reconstruction, we show that a suitably modified Roothian analysis of focus licensing allows us to get bound pronouns to contrast with other bound pronouns. The reason for this is that the number of potential alternatives increases. We also suggest a modification of Rooth’s \textasciitilde -operator: contrastiveness becomes a requirement of the operator, which is modelled as a definedness condition. It is argued that in the case of focused bound pronouns a \textasciitilde -operator is necessarily inserted in the scope of the quantifier. If this is on the right track, it follows that the phenomenon of focused bound pronouns warrants both an operator interpreting focus as well as a semantic value for the contribution of focus. Any givenness-based analysis must include these two ingredients as well; we suggest a way in which this can be implemented more or less straightforwardly.},

We adduce novel evidence that this inference is a presupposition arising from the application of the definite article to the plural noun phrase and that it cannot be explained away by a presuppositional analysis of number-marking (Sauerland 2003). It is proposed that plural- and singular-marking are scalar items subject to obligatory exhaustification (Ivlieva 2013). We show that global exhaustification is, however, untenable in the case of definite plurals, contra (Magri 2014). The semantics of the definite article is shown to force exhaustifiation to occur below itself on the noun phrase directly. Having reached this conclusion for definite plurals, makes it possible to drastically simplify the derivation of the multiplicity inference even in bare plurals when compared to competing proposals such as (Spector 2007a; Zweig 2009).},

The problem comes from disjunctions like Either Mary isn’t pregnant or (she is and) it doesn’t show and in particular from the optional presence of she is (pregnant). These data are even more puzzling if compared to corresponding conditionals like If Mary is pregnant, (\#she is and) it doesn’t show where the she is (pregnant) part is unacceptable as expected. In response to this puzzle, we present a solution based on two ingredients: (i) exhaustification and (ii) a notion of incremental redundancy. As we show, exhaustifying a sentence has an effect on the (incremental) redundancy status of its constituents. As a consequence of this, she is (pregnant) is actually not redundant in the disjunctive sentence above, provided the latter is exhaustified. We explore two possible ways of implementing this solution.  The first is based on a definition of incremental redundancy which does not make use of local contexts as proposed by Fox (2008, 2013), building on Schlenker 2008. The second is based on Schlenker’s (2009) incremental theory of local contexts. We then briefly compare the two implementations and point to a potential advantage of the one based on local contexts in dealing with the different readings of the disjunctive sentence above. http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp.9.7 BibTeX info},

This is problematic for most theories of presupposition projection in the literature, which only predict a condi- tional presupposition for such sentences (Karttunen 1974; Stalnaker 1973; Heim 1983; Beaver 2001; Schlenker 2009; Fox 2008 among others). The general response to this problem, the so-called "Proviso Problem" (Geurts 1996), is to assume that in addition to the basic conditional presupposition, a non-conditional inference can arise depending on the relationship between the antecedent/first disjunct and the presupposition of the consequent/second disjunct. We discuss data for which this solution makes the wrong predictions. Similar data have been taken by van der Sandt (1992), Geurts (1996) and Garcia-Odon (2012) to motivate the DRT-approach to presuppositions. Schlenker (2011), however, has raised various arguments against such an approach. We propose an alternative analysis, which doesn't have those problems. In our analysis, the differing presuppositions are the result of a systematic ambiguity involving exhaustification in a trivalent semantics: a non-conditional presupposition obtains with exhaustification, and a conditional one without. Independently motivated plausibility considerations decide which reading is chosen with no direct selection of presuppositions needed. We discuss how this approach deals with the various cases of proviso and the predictions it makes for biconditional sentences.},

  abstract = {Why do predicates like know embed both declarative and interrogative clauses, whereas closely related ones like believe only embed the former? The standard approach following Grimshaw (Linguist Inq 10:279–326, 1979) to this issue has been to specify lexically for each predicate which type of complement clause it can combine with. This view is challenged by predicates such as be certain, which embed interrogative clauses only in certain contexts. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes (i) a novel, unified semantics for declarative and interrogative embedding and (ii) a theory where embedding is constrained by semantic considerations. The reason for the apparent unembeddability of an interrogative clause under a given predicate is the resulting trivial meaning of the sentence. Such triviality manifests itself in unacceptability. Crucially, it is affected by both the lexical meaning of the predicate and the polarity of the sentence as a whole.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the interpretation and distribution of universal Free Choice (FC) items, such as English FC any or Spanish cualquiera. Crosslinguistically, universal FC items can be characterized as follows. First, they have a restricted distribution. Second, they express freedom of choice: the sentence You can take any card conveys the information that the addressee is free to pick whichever card she chooses. Under standard assumptions, the truth conditions of sentences like You can take any card are taken to be captured by formalizations in which a universal quantifier ranging over individuals has wide scope over the possibility modal. The crucial observation that informs the account in this paper is that this type of formalization cannot capture the freedom of choice component. I will argue that in order to derive the right interaction between possibility modals and FC items, we need to add an exclusiveness condition to the standard wide scope paraphrases. The same proposal that guarantees freedom of choice will automatically account for the distribution restrictions of FC items. The formal implementation of this proposal is cast in the Hamblin semantics proposed in Kratzer and Shimoyama (Indeterminate phrases: The view from Japanese, 2002).},

I argue that the two main theories available so far - the (Neo-)Gricean pragmatic theory on the one hand (e.g., Sauerland (2004)), and the hybrid grammatical theory of scalar implicatures on the other hand (e.g., Fox (2007)) - cannot provide a satisfactory account of disjunctions like Al drank some or all of the beers. As I will show, the meaning of these sentences is characterized by the presence of grammatical ignorance implicatures. In this they differ from their simpler alternatives. I will show how the proposed Matrix K theory of implicature derives this result. The new theory is a radically grammatical theory in that all kinds of implicatures - weak, scalar, and ignorance implicatures - are derived in the grammar. I will also show how Hurford's constraint can be derived from a general principle of manner in the new theory. I will then turn to logically under-informative statements like Some elephants are mammals and show how their oddness falls out from the Matrix K theory without further stipulations. Next, I argue that the theory extends to infelicitous Hurford disjunctions like Jean is from France or from Paris. Both phenomena can receive a uniform explanation in terms of grammatically derived, contextually inconsistent implicatures, without stipulating obligatory scalar implicatures. Lastly, I turn to the case of implicature suspension and show how the new theory can account for missing implicatures.},

  abstract = {This study addresses two interrelated questions: what is the nature of aspectual meaning, and what are the grammatical realizations of aspectual meaning in English? These questions are addressed in part through an examination of the English perfect construction (e.g., The Eagle has landed). In chapter one, I outline a tripartite model of the English aspectual system, consisting of grammatical aspect, situation aspect and phasal aspect. The perfect is depicted as an exponent of phasal aspect. Phasal aspect, according to Coseriu (1976), indicates a relationship between a reference time and "the degree of development of the verbal process under consideration". Exponents of phasal aspect encode a situation type distinct from the Aktionsart of the VP-complement denotatum. I demonstrate that the perfect construction denotes a stative situation: a state of 'aftermath' following the event expressed by the VP complement. Chapter one establishes a formal semantic model for representing phasal aspect. Chapter two uses the Construction Grammar framework to describe the morphosyntactic constructions which encode phasal aspect in English. These constructions are seen as complexes of highly specific semantic, discourse-pragmatic and grammatical properties. The repertoire of aspectual constructions is a structured inventory of form-meaning pairings, in which formal and semantic correspondences between constructions are represented by inheritance links. The various perfect constructions, and their semantic interrelations, are examined in chapters three and four. The grammar is seen as a system of functional oppositions. Accordingly, certain construction-particular constraints on use and interpretation are seen as ecologically based constraints. I argue that while many of these constraints are calculable via Gricean principles, some are instead attributable to a discourse-pragmatic division of labor among two or more synonymous constructions. One such constraint prevents the resultative present-perfect from expressing a pragmatically presupposed event proposition. In chapter five, I argue that this constraint arises from a functional contrast between the resultative present-perfect and preterite. Chapter five further shows that the existential and resultative readings of the present perfect have distinct grammatical and discourse-pragmatic reflexes. The present perfect is regarded as a polysemous construction: a single morphosyntactic form having several related meanings.},

  abstract = {The paper focuses on the semantics of distributivity, grammatical number, and cardinality predicates (numerals and modifiers like several). I argue that constructions involving so-called ‘dependent plurals’, i.e. plurals lacking cardinality predicates occurring in the scope of certain quantificational items such as all and most (e.g. All the girls were wearing hats), pose a challenge to familiar semantic frameworks that distinguish between two sources of multiplicity: mereological plurality and distributive quantification. I argue that dependent plural readings should be analysed as distinct both from cumulative readings and distributive readings, in the classical sense. I demonstrate how this can be accomplished in a semantic framework where expressions are evaluated relative to sets of assignments, or plural info states (van den Berg, in Stokhof and Torenvliet (eds) Proceedings of the 7th Amsterdam Colloquium, ILLC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1990, in Dekker and Stokhof (eds) Proceedings of the 9th Amsterdam Colloquium, ILLC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1994, Some aspects of the Internal Structure of Discourse. The Dynamics of Nominal Anaphora. PhD thesis, University of Amsterdam, 1996). The specific formal implementation is based on a modified version of Brasoveanu’s (Structured nominal and modal reference. PhD thesis, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 2007, Linguist Philos 31(2):129–209. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10988-008-9035-0, 2008) Plural Compositional DRT. In this framework we are able to distinguish between two types of distributivity: weak distributivity across the assignments in a single plural info state and strong distributivity across multiple info states. I argue that both of these types of distributivity play a role in the semantics of natural language, accounting for the contrasting properties of ‘singular quantifiers’, such as each and every, and ‘plural quantifiers’, such as all and most. The contrasting properties of bare plurals and plurals involving cardinality modifiers are analysed in terms of the distinction between state-level and assignment-level (mereological) plurality.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel scope paradox. Providing data from Farsi, I show that indefinites in the surface syntactic scope of negated intensional operators yield a reading in which the indefinite appears to take wider scope over the negation, and narrow scope with respect to the intensional operator. Genuine generalized quantifiers, in contrast, do not yield such readings. The uniqueness of indefinites in giving rise to such wide pseudo-scope de dicto readings, which are also found within a simple clause, provides evidence that indefinites differ from generalized quantifiers, not only in their ability to take exceptional scope across clause boundaries, but also in their local scopal properties. I argue that the existence of such wide pseudo-scope de dicto readings not only poses a problem for the generalized quantifier view of indefinites, but also for any approach that takes indefinites to scope via syntactic movement. In-situ accounts of indefinites, on the other hand, can straightforwardly account for the new data, without over-generating wide scope de dicto readings (a.k.a. the “fourth readings”) which are widely believed to be impossible (von Fintel \&amp; Heim 2011, Keshet \&amp; Schwarz 2019, Elliott 2023). I argue that an account in terms of world-Skolemized choice functions is more successful in accounting for the full pattern of the wide pseudo-scope de dicto reading in Farsi, as well as cross-linguistic variation in the availability of such readings.

  abstract = {Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.},

  abstract = {Implicative verbs (e.g., manage, dare) are characterized by complement inferences (Karttunen, 1971). English manage entails its complement; the entailment reverses polarity with matrix negation, and is accompanied by a projective inference to the complement’s non-triviality (Coleman, 1975; Karttunen \&amp; Peters, 1979). I use data from Finnish and English to argue that the implicative inferential profile is derived from backgrounded relations of causal necessity and causal sufficiency (defined over the structure of a formal causal model; Pearl 2000; Schulz 2011) which link the lexical content of an implicative verb to the realization of its complement. The proposal builds on Baglini \&amp; Francez’s (2016) causal analysis of manage, but significantly revises the earlier proposal to offer a treatment which accounts not only for English manage, but extends to the lexical semantics of the full implicative class, including ‘polarity-reversing’ verbs like fail, lexically specific verbs like dare, and their Finnish counterparts. Unlike earlier analyses, the proposed causal semantics also provides a natural explanation of the commonalities between two-way entailing verbs like manage and a related class of weaker ‘one-way’ implicatives such as Finnish jaksaa (‘have the strength’), which entail complement truth values under only one matrix polarity, but generate strong pragmatic implicatures in the two-way implicative pattern under the non-entailing polarity.},

In this paper we present arguments against this view based on scrambling in Dutch. We discuss a range of implementations of the cartographic approach and show that they are either too weak, in that they cannot generate all the word orders found in Dutch, or too strong, in that they fail to capture restrictions on scrambling. The alternative we present dispenses with discourse-related functional projections and instead relies on mapping rules that associate syntactic representations with representations in information structure. On this view, scrambling operations derive a syntactic configuration that matches the structural description of a mapping rule that could otherwise not apply. We suggest that it is this interface effect that licenses the marked structures created by scrambling.},

  abstract = {Words which are commonly called “demonstratives” in Passamaquoddy, an Eastern Algonquian language, inflect for a range of grammatical categories and refer deictically and anaphorically to people, animals, and objects. There are also several types of items that take certain of the phonological forms from this demonstrative paradigm, but otherwise show different grammatical and functional characteristics: they make use of a more restricted range of the paradigm, have different distributional behavior, and serve as temporal deictics, manner deictics, clausal connectives, copulas, and distributive quantifiers. In this study, all items which have the phonological shape of words from the demonstrative paradigm are labeled “demonstrative words”. The characteristics of the various demonstrative words are discussed, and their word class membership considered on the basis of inflectional and distributional properties. It is argued that while Passamaquoddy demonstrative words fall into several different word classes, they are all historically related, and have developed distinct formal and functional properties through processes of grammaticalization. Specific grammaticalization pathways are proposed for each type of demonstrative word, explaining how these changes could have come about. The discussion also addresses issues related to the synchronic determination of word classes when diachronic processes may have led to some degree of grammatical differentiation, with the aim of producing more consistent word class classifications for Passamaquoddy and Algonquian languages in general.},

Roughly, a counterfactual of the form A\,{$>$}\,C (if A were the case, C would be the case) is true iff the closest A-worlds are all Cworlds, where the closeness of a world is a function of its similarity, in a certain sense, to the actual world. I argue that this is deeply misguided. In some cases we may only care about the closest A-worlds, but quite often we care about some broader variety of A-worlds varying in closeness. After presenting several problem cases for the similarity-based paradigm, some new and some known, I propose an alternative paradigm for the semantics of counterfactuals, which introduces the notion of Ascenarios, understood roughly as different ways of making A true. According to this view, A\,{$>$}\,C is true iff all the contextually relevant ways of making A true also make C true. I then more carefully spell out a working view that formalizes this idea with greater precision, and explore the consequences of that version of the view.},

Von Fintel’s view is motivated largely by so-called reverse Sobel sequences, about which the standard view seems to make the wrong predictions. (The other major motivation is data surrounding so-called negative polarity items, which I do not discuss here.) More recently Moss (Noûs 46(3):561–586, 2012) has offered a pragmatic/epistemic explanation that purports to explain the data without requiring abandonment of the standard view. So far the small amount of subsequent literature has focused primarily on the original class of cases motivating the strict conditional view. What is needed in the debate is an examination of the predictions of the dynamic strict conditional account for a broader range of data. I undertake this task here, presenting a slew of cases that are problematic for the strict conditional view but not for Moss’s view, and considering some possible responses. Ultimately I take my contribution to constitute a significant blow to the dynamic strict conditional view, though not a decisive verdict against it.},

The meaning of the perfect introduces a base eventuality and a perfect state whose category is underspecified semantically. Neo-Gricean reasoning leads hearers to appropriately fill in the value of that variable. We present the results of a corpus study of over 600 present perfect examples. The results of this study suggest that (i) most English present perfects receive entailed resultative or continuative readings, (ii) the English perfect need not elaborate on a preexisting topic, and (iii) the English perfect plays a role in establishing discourse coherence by helping hearers establish discourse relations between discourse segments.},

First, evaluative adjectives with a negative evaluative meaning tend to turn into deadjectival intensifiers expressing high degree, while adjectives with a positive meaning make intensifiers of medium degree. Second, negative modal adjectives can form deadjectival intensifiers, but positive ones cannot. I will argue that a relatively simple intersective semantics for evaluative and modal adverbs accounts for these observations, but that we can only show this if we supplement that semantic analysis with a probabilistic pragmatic component.

  abstract = {A conversational implicature is an inference that consists of attributing to a speaker an implicit meaning that goes beyond the explicit linguistic meaning of an utterance. This paper experimentally investigates scalar implicature, a paradigmatic case of implicature in which a speaker's use of a term like Some indicates that the speaker had reasons not to use a more informative term from the same scale, e.g. All; thus, Some implicates Not all. Pragmatic theorists like Grice would predict that a pragmatic interpretation is determined only after its explicit, logical meaning is incorporated (e.g. where Some means at least one). The present work aims to developmentally examine this prediction by showing how younger, albeit competent, reasoners initially treat a relatively weak term logically before becoming aware of its pragmatic potential. Three experiments are presented. Experiment 1 presents a modal reasoning scenario offering an exhaustive set of conclusions; critical among these is participants' evaluation of a statement expressing Might be x when the context indicates that the stronger Must be x is true. The conversationally-infelicitous Might be x can be understood logically (e.g. as compatible with Must) or pragmatically (as exclusive to Must). Results from 5-, 7-, and 9-year-olds as well as adults revealed that (a) 7-year-olds are the youngest to demonstrate modal competence overall and that (b) 7- and 9-year-olds treat the infelicitous Might logically significantly more often than adults do. Experiment 2 showed how training with the modal task can suspend the implicatures for adults. Experiment 3 provides converging evidence of the developmental pragmatic effect with the French existential quantifier Certains (Some). While linguistically-sophisticated children (8- and 10-year-olds olds) typically treat Certains as compatible with Tous (All), adults are equivocal. These results, which are consistent with unanticipated findings in classic developmental papers, reveal a consistent ordering in which representations of weak scalar terms tend to be treated logically by young competent participants and more pragmatically by older ones. This work is also relevant to the treatment of scalar implicatures in the reasoning literature.},

We describe the syntactic and semantic properties of interrogative nominalizations and diye/to-clauses. We show that the interrogative nominalizations give rise to familiar answer-oriented inferences with responsive predicates, but that interrogative diye/to-clauses must remain question-oriented. In particular, they give rise to the entailment that the attitude holder linguistically produce the question that they introduce. We propose a compositional fragment where attitude predicates take nominalizations as arguments, which they may impose semantic restrictions on, and where diye/to-clauses modify and enrich attitude meanings with a linguistic production inference. We end with a discussion of whether this proposal is viable uniformly for all instances of diye/to-clauses.},

This makes it important to be able to decide reliably whether a given clause-embedding predicate, in a given language, is focus-sensitive or not. In this paper, we critically assess the applicability, within and across languages, of three empirical tests for focus-sensitivity: One based on truth value judgments; another one based on judgments of coherence or contradiction; and a third one, our original proposal, based on judgments about the presence or absence of a particular inference. We identify the main limitations of each test, and suggest how they can be used in unison to provide a diagnosis of focus-sensitivity that is reliable, and that minimizes effort on the part of researchers and language consultants.},

  abstract = {In the literature on homogeneity, summative predicates have been described as quantifying universally over their argument’s parts in positive sentences, while being negated existentials in negative sentences. In this article, I provide a fuller picture of these predicates’ quantificational force in positive sentences through various ‘co-predications’—sentences in which two summative predicates are predicated of the same individual. In some co-predications, summative predicates are universal; in others, they are weaker, while remaining stronger than existential. In light of this new empirical paradigm, I suggest that summative predicates are lexically existential, but are exhaustified so as to exclude other same-class predicates. In addition to making this proposal, I also show that no other theory of homogeneity can capture the co-predicational paradigm.},

  abstract = {Cheng and Huang (1996) argue that both unselective binding and E-type pronoun strategies are necessary for the interpretation of natural language sentences and claim that there exists a correspondence between two sentence types in Chinese and the two strategies, namely that the interpretation of the “wh … wh” construction (which they call “bare conditional”) employs the unselective binding strategy, while the ruguo ‘if ’ and dou ‘all’ conditionals use the E-type pronoun strategy. They also suggest that there is a complementary distribution between bare conditionals and ruguo/dou conditionals in the sense that the latter allows all the NP forms, e.g. (empty) pronouns and definite NPs, except for wh-phrases in their consequent clauses, and can even have a consequent clause with no anaphoric NP in it, while the former permits only the same wh-phrase appearing in both the antecedent clause and the consequent clause. Although we agree with Cheng and Huang on the necessity of the two strategies in natural language interpretation, we see apparent exceptions to the correspondence between sentence types and interpretation strategies and the complementary distribution between wh-phrases and other NPs in bare conditionals and ruguo/dou conditionals. We think that the claimed correspondence and complementary distribution are the default or preferred patterns, or a special case of a more general picture, namely that (i) bare conditionals prefer the unselective binding strategy and the ruguo ‘if ’ and dou ‘all’ conditionals, the E-type pronoun strategy; and (ii) wh-phrases are more suitable for being a bound variable, and pronouns are more suitable for being the E-type pronoun. This paper proposes a Bound Variable Hierarchy to help account for the distribution of wh-phrases and pronouns in Chinese conditionals and claims that any deviation from the preferred patterns will require additional contexts or accommodation.},

We propose that evaluation time shift, a mechanism independently attested in the narrative present in languages with tense, is more widely used in Paraguayan Guarani for encoding temporal meaning.

Grosz (2012) observes that they can sometimes give rise to what he calls minimal sufficiency readings, which seem to affirm, rather than negate, focus alternatives. Grosz proposes to analyze them in terms of the rank-order reading, a kind of scalar reading of exclusive particles that is independently attested. Coppock \&amp; Beaver (2014) put forward a similar analysis based on their unified semantics for different uses of exclusive particles. We point out that these previous accounts fail to capture the distribution of minimal sufficiency readings, in particular, the relevance of distributivity, and propose an alternative analysis where the scalar component of the minimal sufficiency reading comes from a covert version of even, rather than from the exclusive particle itself. Empirical support for this comes from the generalization that an overt even can be added to sentences that have minimal sufficiency readings without changing the meaning, but not to sentences that do not allow for minimal sufficiency readings. We argue that our account not only captures the distribution of the minimal sufficiency reading, but also derives the inferences involved in the minimal sufficiency reading compositionally together with the standardly assumed semantics for exclusive particles and even.},

This holds independently of the approach adopted, be it the analysis of SCs as lexical projections with different category labels (cf. Stowell 1981, Matushansky 2019) or the uniform analysis of SCs as PredP (cf. Bowers 1993). In Chinese, there is no root vs non-root asymmetry for predicates: If a category X is not licit as an autonomous predicate in matrix sentences, then it is not licit as predicate elsewhere, i.e. in non-root clauses, either. Furthermore, Chinese has no exceptional case marking verbs, i.e. verbs selecting SC-complements. Claims to the contrary in the literature are based on Chinese translations of English SCs and involve completely different structures. Given the lack of SCs in non-root contexts in Chinese, an analysis postulating SCs for non-verbal~predication in matrix sentences does not seem to be warranted.},

But on the other hand, if every lexical noun could be characterized by both +mass and +count, then various of the desiderata would be captured. So we conclude that lexical nouns should be neither +mass nor +count, and both +mass and +count. Although this investigation is carried out in English, the moral holds for any ‘number marking’ language. Furthermore, the resulting theory is the one that is naturally congenial to classifier languages, showing a hithertofore unnoticed similarity between the two language classes.

Our theory is that exceptives depend on generalizations, which can but need not be universal, whose generality they limit, and some of whose exceptions they comment on. Every generalization intrinsically partitions its domain of applicability into regular cases, which are as it says to expect, and exceptions, which are not. A generalization’s exceptions are instances that falsify it if sufficiently prevalent. These two facts underpin the meaning of exceptives as combining a generality claim with an exception claim, giving correct truth conditions for the several ways the three exceptive prepositions are used, and significantly improving on existing semantic accounts in the literature. We support this by analyzing a wide range of examples. The analysis applies whether or not the phrase following the exceptive preposition is a DP, and whether or not the generalization is expressed with a quantifier. We further argue that these exceptive prepositions are synonymous, contrary to the widely held view that a difference in meaning explains their different syntactic distributions.},

  abstract = {Proceedings of the ESSLLI 2022 Student Session Gathered solutions from numerous problems: Anti-monotonicity, restrictiveness, star operators Lorenzo Pinton In this paper we study the different patterns that gather-like and numerous-like predicates present in restrictive relative clauses. Restrictive relative clauses represents a novel case in which the two types of collective predicates differ, alongside the known cases involving proportional quantifiers and non-proportional partitive constructions. The first part of the solution provides an explanation on why numerous is generally bad in restrictive relative clauses. Since numerous is monotonic with respect to the parthood relation of plurals, any attempt of restriction will end up including the maximal element of the complete join semilattice, which is the sum of all the atoms. This results in triviality, since each member of the predicate that should be restricted is part of at least one numerous plural individual. The second part of the solution provides an analysis on why restrictive numerous is fine if it applies to complex predicates like gather students. Exploiting syntactic theories of pluralization, we argue that when the star operator is absent from gather, it can modify a plural predicate without preserving the complete join semilattice and this allows restriction by numerous.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study how different FC inferences are derived in cases of sluiced sentences that differ just by the verb embedding the sluice, improving on Fusco (2019). We propose to add a new economy condition to Rudin (2019) that is able to derive – together with other existing constraints – the desired sluices from certain syntactico-semantic properties (temporal orientation; Condoravdi 2001) of embedding verbs. We then present an analysis in which the attested FC inferences are derived from the different sluices through the interplay of scopal parallelism (Chung et al. 1995; Fusco 2019) and uniqueness presupposition of singular 'which' clauses (Dayal 1996).},

This claim is based on the observation that (1a) has no reading in which reviewers covary with plays, while (2a) does. Current theories capture the contrast by making Quantifier Raising (QR), the covert syntactic operation that assigns scope to quantified noun phrases (QPs), clause-bound. Only in (2a), in which the universally quantified QP every play and the indefinite a reviewer are clausemates, can the universal QP raise to scope over the indefinite, yielding the Logical Form representation (LF) in (2b). This operation is prohibited for (1a) because the two NPs are not clausemates; hence, the LF in (1b) is illicit.},

Combining ideas of previous evolutionary and probabilistic approaches (e.g., Potts 2008; Franke 2012; Lassiter 2011; Lassiter \&amp; Goodman 2013), we propose a new model that makes exact and empirically testable probabilistic predictions about speakers' use of gradable adjectives and that derives the relative-absolute distinction from considerations of optimal language use. Along the way, we distinguish between vagueness and loose use, and argue that, within our approach, vagueness can be understood as the result of uncertainty about the exact degree distribution within the comparison class.},

Zooming in, non-veridical preferential predicates (NVPs) such as hope and fear have been claimed not to combine with questions but this empirical generalization as well as its proposed explanation have been challenged by a number of counterexamples, whose properties---beyond the fact that they feature embedded questions---remain ill understood. By taking a closer look at the combinatorial and semantic properties of different NVPs from English, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish and Turkish, this work narrows down the semantic properties of attitude predicates that determine their combinatorial properties in a cross-linguistically informed and predictive way. We identify a class of hope-like predicates that are restricted both in the kinds of question complements that they may combine with and in their interpretation with them. Roughly, hope whether p is sometimes attested, and always means hope that p. We also identify other classes of NVPs that are freer to combine with different kinds of questions and give rise to a wider range of interpretations.},

From this perspective, mood morphology conveys information about model flow in discourse, which can be determined by a variety of factors ranging from lexical meaning of embedding predicates to different aspects of discourse interpretation and context change. The proposal identifies and analyzes the parameters that induce model shift in subordinated domains. This allows us to distinguish core cases of subjunctive selection from more peripheral ones, both within a language and crosslinguistically, and it also provides us with an explanation for several empirical problems that a rigid interpetation of mood leaves unresolved. The analysis offered concentrates on mood distribution in Catalan and Spanish.},

Externally, both kinds of structures serve to restrict domains of operators. The differences follow from the fact that unconditionals involve interrogative structure, and consequently the meaning of a question. Where a root question acts to raise an issue in discourse, a question meaning in the content of a conditional clause acts differently—it acts to provide an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive domain restrictions to a main-clause operator. The dissertation provides extensive syntactic arguments that unconditionals involve interrogative structure, as opposed to any kind of relative structure. “Wh-ever” unconditional adjuncts syntactically are closest to root “wh-ever” questions, such as “Whatever happened to Alfonso?”. I provide a semantics for such questions, arguing that “-ever” serves to widen the intensional domain of interpretation—the set of possible worlds used to evaluate the question's meaning. This analysis leads to a unified interpretation for “wh-ever” unconditional adjuncts and root “wh-ever” questions.},

An often cited type of example is “The [relative of his] [which every man admires most] is his mother.”, where the pronoun “his” in the relative head appears to be bound by the quantified noun phrase “every man” in the relative clause – although the latter does not c-command the former, which is commonly required for binding. Several solutions have been developed in various theoretical frameworks. One interesting aspect about reconstruction effects in relative clauses is that they can be used as a benchmark for competing theories of grammar: Which architecture of the syntax-semantics interface can provide the most satisfying explanation for these phenomena? This volume brings together researchers working in different frameworks but looking at the same set of empirical facts, enabling the reader to develop their own perspective on the perfect tradeoff between syntax and semantics in a theory of grammar.},

Larry Horn’s chapter, which opens the book, provides an interesting and remarkably documented investigation on the phenomenon’s historic development, evoking proto-pragmatic accounts of De Morgan and Mill, and even extending discussion to Grice’s manner maxim. An experimental chapter is contributed by Alexandre Cr em er s and Emmanuel Chemla. In their study, they focus on the processing cost involved in the derivation of both direct (that is, from some to not all) and indirect (that is, from not all to some) scalar implicatures, and argue that the very same processing signature generalizes to all subclasses of the phenomenon. Based on their findings, Lhey also provide a useful discussion on how to compare scalar implicatures with other kinds of inferences and on how to identify the subprocesses responsible for the processing cost of scalar implicatures. Within the formal contributions is a really useful survey, written by Michael Franke and Gerhard Jäger, of game theoretic models that captures, what they call, pragmatic back-and-forth reasoning about mutual beliefs and linguistic behavior. This contribution is a worthwhile read for those with no immediate interest in the scalar implicatures debate (for game theoretic discussion may provide useful insights to understanding the mechanisms behind a number of linguistic phenomena) as well as those researchers who are involved (for, from a pragmatic perspective, a rigorous theory of communicative rationality is needed to throw some light on the Gricean project on communication).},

The semantic content of an imperative clause amounts to realization conditions in the form of a de se property indexed to the addressee, which involves a circumstantial, futurate modal. Second person indexicality facilitates an empirically superior novel account of the semantic contributions of overt imperative subjects, as in nobody move!. The often-attested deontic flavor of imperative modality is not semantic, nor is directive force itself; rather, these arise from the canonical pragmatic role of imperatives: updating a distinguished body of shared information G in the context of utterance. Unlike the CommonGround — consisting of propositions which the interlocutors (purport to) believe, and the QUD — the questions which they are committed to resolving, G consists of the publicly evident goals of the interlocutors, organized to reflect their plans and priorities. G is updated by and influences the understood meaningnn of an imperative utterance, including how its Kratzerian ModalBase and OrderingSource are derived. Thus, the account shares features with the most prominent recent theories of imperative semantics (especially Charlow’s use of plans, Kaufmann’s modality, and Portner’s dynamic pragmatics), but differs from all in its empirical adequacy and in the way that it distinguishes semantic from pragmatic features of imperative utterances.

A requirement of Relevance is satisfied by an utterance (whether an assertion, a question or a suggestion) iff it addresses the question under discussion.

Based on the proposed tests, it is argued that though Topicality is reflected across a wide variety of the world’s languages, it is realized rather differently from language to language, presumably in part as a function of the languages’ inherent syntactic and semantic resources. The resulting picture argues for more careful methodology in selecting and analyzing the data on which theories of the role of Topicality in natural language are developed, with implications for syntax, semantics and pragmatics.},

Dynamic inquisitive semantics: Anaphora and questions. Sinn und Bedeutung 23. 365–382). Within this framework, we develop a compositional treatment of wh-questions whose basic premise is that a wh-phrase introduces a discourse referent u , just like non-interrogative indefinites do, and requires the presence of an operator in the left periphery of the clause which requests a witness for u , i.e.,~it raises an issue whose resolution requires identifying at least one individual that has all the properties ascribed to u . In previous work, it has been argued that a dynamic semantic analysis of questions is needed to account for anaphora with wh-antecedents and for certain kinds of intervention effects (Haida, Andreas. 2007. The indefiniteness and focusing of wh-words . Berlin: Humboldt University PhD thesis). Here, we further develop the general approach and argue that it has several additional benefits. Namely, it allows for a uniform treatment of single-wh and multiple-wh questions, it derives mention-some and mention-all readings in a principled way, as well as an often neglected partial mention-some reading in multiple-wh questions, it can capture certain constraints on the availability of mention-some readings, and the effects of number marking on which -phrases across single-wh and multiple-wh questions.},

This semantics suffers from a well-known difficulty with disjunctive antecedents (see e.g. Alonso-Ovalle, 2009; Willer, 2018; Santorio, 2018, a.o.). In a recent study, Ciardelli, Zhang, and Champollion (Ciardelli et al., 2018b; henceforth, CZC) present new, related difficulties for the classical approach having to do with unpredicted differences between counterfactuals with De Morgan-equivalent antecedents, and related pattern of inferences. They propose a new semantics for counterfactuals, which builds on inquisitive semantics (see Ciardelli et al., 2018a) and gives up on minimal change. Building on this debate, we report on a series of experiments that investigate the role of overt negation in this data. Our results replicate CZC’s main effects, but they also indicate that those effects are linked to the presence of overt negation. We propose a novel account, based on three key assumptions: (i) the semantics for counterfactuals does involve a notion of minimal change, after all; (ii) the meanings of disjunction and negation are associated with alternatives, which interact with the meaning of counterfactuals; (iii) the alternatives generated by negation are partially determined by the question under discussion (QUD). We compare our account with other existing accounts, including CZC’s own proposal, as well as Schulz (2019) and Bar-Lev \&amp; Fox (2020) ones.},

  abstract = {Sentences involving disjunctions under a possibility modal give rise to so-called ‘free choice’ inferences, i.e. inferences to the effect that each disjunct is possible. This note investigates the interaction between free choice and presuppositions. We focus on sentences embedding both a disjunction in the scope of a possibility modal and a presupposition trigger, and we investigate how the free choice inference triggered by the former can contribute to filtering the presupposition of the latter. We consider three cases: conditionals, disjunctions and unless sentences. We observe that in all of these cases the presuppositions triggered from the consequent, second disjunct, or the scope of unless appear to be filtered by a free choice inference associated with the rest of the sentence. The case of the conditional can be accommodated by scalar accounts of free choice, but the disjunction and unless cases cause a substantial problem for all these accounts. After discarding a natural but unsuccessful attempt at a solution, we consider two more promising strategies. The first holds on to an implicature account of free choice and exploits an algorithm of free insertion of redundant material. The second is based on a semantic account of free choice based on a notion of homogeneity. Each of these solutions comes with related problems. We conclude that the correct form of a theory of free choice remains open, though the data concerning the interaction between free choice and presupposition can significantly help sharpen our theoretical choices.

It is standardly claimed that while (i) the true answer must be completely specified, it is not necessary that (ii) it be specified *as being* the complete answer. Here the non-factive verbs 'tell' and 'predict' are said to differ from the factive verb 'know', which typically does impose the *strong exhaustivity* requirement in (ii). We argue for an intermediate reading of 'tell' and 'predict' that requires more than (i) but less than (ii). To account for this reading we claim that the exhaustivity requirement (ii) imposed by 'know' is due to an operator than can apply non-locally. Applying the operator above a non-factive verb derives the intermediate reading, whereas doing so is vacuous in the case of factives. Thus, we derive the intermediate reading, and differences in the exhaustivity requirements imposed by factives and non-factives, without lexical stipulation. doi:10.3765/sp.4.2 BibTeX info},

  abstract = {This article offers an account of the mass/count distinction and the semantics of count nouns, and argues that it is not based on an atomic/non-atomic nor on a homogeneous/non-homogeneous distinction. I propose that atomicity in the count domain is atomicity relative to a context k, where k is a set of entities that count as atoms (i.e. count as one) in a particular context. Assuming for simplicity Chierchia's (1998a) and Rothstein's (2004) theory of mass nouns, in which they denote atomic Boolean semi-lattices closed under the complete join operation, we define an operation COUNTk that applies to the mass noun denotation Nmass and derives the count noun meaning: a set of ordered pairs \&lt;d,k\&gt; where d is a member of N ∩ k and k is the context k relative to which the operation applied. So, there is a typal distinction between mass nouns, which are of type \&lt;d,t\&gt;, and count nouns, which are of type \&lt;d×k, t\&gt;. The grammatical differences between count and mass nouns follow from this typal distinction. This allows us to encode grammatically the distinction between semantic atomicity, that is, atomicity relative to a context k, and natural atomicity, that is, inherent individuability. We show a number of ways in which this distinction is grammatically relevant.},

  abstract = {Recent work proposes that modal auxiliaries project their domains from an event variable, their ‘anchor’ (Hacquard 2006, 2010, Kratzer 2013). Based on the Spanish modal indefinite uno cualquiera, Alonso-Ovalle \&amp; Menéndez-Benito (2018) conclude that modal indefinites do too. This paper argues that yalnhej DPs, a type of modal indefinite in Chuj, an understudied Mayan language, support this conclusion. These DPs are existential quantifiers that convey an at-issue modal component, like uno cualquiera. They pattern with uno cualquiera in conveying random choice modality with volitional verbs, but only when they are tied to internal argument positions. Yalnhej DPs depart from uno cualquiera in that they can also convey epistemic modality. They also depart from other epistemic modal indefinites insofar as they can, but do not have to, describe situations where the speaker knows that the whole domain satisfies the existential claim. Our analysis of yalnhej DPs builds upon the analysis of uno cualquiera in Alonso-Ovalle \&amp; Menéndez-Benito 2018, from which it departs in assuming that yalnhej DPs tolerate anchors with epistemic content. Furthermore, in line with other Chuj DPs, yalnhej DPs are not upper bounded. This results in an epistemic component that does not convey speaker ignorance when the whole domain satisfies the existential claim. Finally, unlike uno cualquiera, yalnhej DPs do not have an interpretation conveying that the witness of the existential claim is unremarkable. We link this fact to a lack of predicative uses, in support of the view that the random choice and ‘unremarkable’ interpretations stem from an ambiguity, as anticipated in Alonso-Ovalle \&amp; Menéndez-Benito 2018 and Alonso-Ovalle \&amp; Royer 2021.

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to experimentally evaluate contrasting claims in the theoretical literature on the acceptability of Mandarin demonstratives and definite bare nouns in anaphoric contexts. Jenks (2018) argues that Mandarin differentiates between uniqueness-based (weak) and anaphoric (strong) definites through bare nouns and demonstratives, respectively. In contrast, Dayal \& Jiang (2022), Bremmers, Liu, van der Klis \& Le Bruyn (2022), and Simpson \& Wu (2022) claim that both bare nouns and demonstratives can be used in anaphoric contexts in Mandarin, proposing slightly differing explanations with regards to their felicity, tied to factors such as discourse coherence between context and follow-up sentences. Our findings illustrate that Mandarin demonstratives are strongly preferred across the board in anaphoric contexts, patterning with anaphoric definites (rather than demonstratives) in languages such as English, Turkish (Saha, Sağ \& Davidson 2023), and Bangla (Saha 2023). Additionally, we observe that definite bare nouns are also felicitous in anaphoric contexts, albeit as a less preferred option. We argue that this preference for demonstratives arises because Mandarin bare nouns can have (i) generic interpretations due to the absence of tense and aspectual marking, and (ii)indefinite interpretations in post-verbal positions (Cheng \& Sybesma 1999; Simpson \& Wu 2022). Demonstratives, by contrast, are unambiguously anaphoric, driving their overall preference.},

This is particularly evident in the expression of new information focus, where the best prosodic position for main stress does not necessarily match the best syntactic position for the constituent being focused. Since focus must be stressed, either stress or the focused constituent must abandon their best position, violating either the syntactic or the prosodic constraints responsible for it. This paper argues for an optimality theoretic analysis of this conflict, showing how different focus paradigms reflect different rankings of the relevant syntactic and prosodic constraints. As we will see, only an optimality analysis can account for the paradigm of Italian focus while maintaining the kind of prosodic theory of main stress emerged from prosodic studies in the last two decades. Furthermore, the analysis extends naturally to focus paradigms in English, French, and Chichewa with no need for language-specific parametric devices. The conflicting nature of prosodic and syntactic constraints determines a complex crosslinguistic typology from a single set of universal constraints with interface conditions kept to an absolute minimum.},

I show that pragmatic accounts of Simplification fail, and develop a truthmaker semantics for conditionals that captures all the relevant data.

  abstract = {Sentences involving disjunction under epistemic modal adjectives — such as possible, likely, and certain — give rise to the inference that the disjuncts are epistemically possible. Inferences of this sort are often classified and treated differently, depending on the force of the embedding modal. Those triggered by possibility modals are singled out as ‘free choice inferences’ (Kratzer \&amp; Shimoyama 2002, Klinedinst 2007, Fox 2007, Chierchia 2013, a.o.), while those triggered by stronger modals are called and accounted for in a different way (Sauerland 2004, Fox 2007, Crnič et al. 2015 a.o.). In this paper, we pursue two goals. First, we develop and defend a degree semantics for epistemic modal adjectives, building on much recent work on the topic (Yalcin 2010, Lassiter 2011, 2014, Moss 2015, Swanson 2015, a.o.). Second, we show that this semantics, in combination with the assumption that scalar implicatures can arise in embedded position (Fox 2007, Chierchia et al. 2012 a.o.), can predict all the inferences triggered by disjunction under modals, including free choice ones, via a uniform mechanism. We conclude by outlining how the proposal can be extended to epistemic modal items in other syntactic categories, and to modals of different flavor. BibTeX Info},

  abstract = {The theory of language must predict the possible thought—signal (or meaning—sound or sign) pairings of a language. We argue for a Meaning First architecture of language where a thought structure is generated first. The thought structure is then realized using language to communicate the thought, to memorize it, or perhaps with another purpose. Our view contrasts with the T-model architecture of mainstream generative grammar, according to which distinct phrase-structural representations—Phonetic Form (PF) for articulation, Logical Form (LF) for interpretation—are generated within the grammar. At the same time, our view differs from early transformational grammar and generative semantics: We view the relationship between the thought structure and the corresponding signal as one of compression. We specify a formal sketch of compression as a choice between multiple possible pronounciations balancing the desire to transmit information against the effort of pronounciation. The Meaning First architecture allows a greater degree of independence between thought structures and the linguistic signal. We present three arguments favoring this type of independence. First we argue that scopal properties can be better explained if we only compare thought structures independent of the their realization as a sentence. Secondly, we argue that Meaning First architecture allows contentful late insertion, an idea that has been argued for in Distributed Morphology already, but as we argue is also motivated by the division of the logical and socio-emotive meaning content of language. Finally, we show that only the Meaning First architecture provides a satisfying account of the mixing of multiple languages by multilingual speakers, especially for cases of simultaneous articulation across two modalities in bimodal speakers. Our view of the structure of grammar leads to a reassessment of priorities in linguistic analyses: while current mainstream work is often focused on establishing one-to-one relationships between concepts and morphemes, our view makes it plausible that primitive concepts are frequently marked indirectly or unpronounced entirely. Our view therefore assigns great value to the understanding of logical primitives and of compression.},

Grice (1967, 1975, 1989) introduced the term implkature for a variety of cancellable inferences and simultaneously suggested an explanation of implicatures on the basis of his maxims — a pragmatic explanation. Horn (1972) extended this type of account to scalar implicatures. However, many in the field (e.g., Levin-son 2000; Chierchia 2004) have already used Grice’s and Horn’s terms as descriptive labels for a range of phenomena, without committing to a specific explanation, as I will in the following.},

We argue that it provides a novel account for cases of quantificational expressions that are frequently marked with genitive case in Japanese. Genitive case attached to nouns marks possession or partitivity, but on quantifiers it has been previously regarded as purely morphological. We show that genitive case on quantifiers can be analyzed as regular genitive case, and identify two distinct structures based on the two noun partitive structure. Specifically, we claim that the genitive suffix can be stranded by NP ellipsis, but when it can attach to a preceeding quantifier the structure remains grammatical. Our analysis therefore supports an analysis of partitives assuming two noun positions where ellipsis can target one or both of those two nouns.This article is part of Special Collection: Partitives},

  abstract = {In the 1980's, the analysis of presupposition projection contributed to a ‘dynamic turn’ in semantics: the classical notion of meanings as truth conditions was replaced with a dynamic notion of meanings as Context Change Potentials (Heim 1983). We explore an alternative in which presupposition projection follows from the combination of a fully classical semantics with two pragmatic principles of manner, Be Articulate and Be Brief. Be Articulate is a violable constraint which requires that a meaning p p′ , conceptualized as involving a pre-condition p (its ‘presupposition’), should be articulated as … (p and p p′) … ( e.g. … it is raining and John knows it …) rather than as … p p′ …. Be Brief , which is more highly ranked than Be Articulate , disallows a full conjunction whose first element is semantically idle. In particular, … (p and p p′) … is ruled out by Be Brief – and hence … p p′ … is acceptable despite Be Articulate – if one can determine as soon as p and is uttered that no matter how the sentence ends these words could be eliminated without affecting its contextual meaning. Two equivalence theorems guarantee that these principles derive Heim's results in almost all cases. Unlike dynamic semantics, our analysis does not encode in the meaning of connectives the left-right asymmetry which is often found in presupposition projection; instead, we give a flexible analysis of this incremental bias, which allows us to account for some ‘symmetric readings’ in which the bias is overridden (e.g. If the bathroom is not hidden, this house has no bathroom ).},

This is the ‘Triggering Problem,’ which we attack from a new angle: we investigate highly iconic constructions in gestures (speech-replacing gestures or ‘pro-speech gestures’) and in signs (classifier predicates in ASL) and show that some regularly trigger presuppositions. These iconic constructions can be created and understood ‘on the fly,’ with two advantages over lexical words: they suggest the existence of a productive ‘triggering algorithm,’ since presuppositions can arguably be generated with no prior exposure to the iconic construction; and they make it possible to minimally modify the target constructions to determine which do and which do not generate presuppositions. Our investigation does not just target standard presuppositions, but also ‘cosuppositions,’ initially defined as conditionalized presuppositions triggered by co-speech gestures. We show that pro-speech gestures and classifier predicates alike can trigger cosuppositions, which are thus an inferential class that goes beyond the confines of co-speech gestures (Aristodemo 2017). Our data argue for a triggering algorithm that can generate presuppositions on iconic grounds, and we offer a generalization of cosupposition theory on which these can be triggered for reasons of manner (co-speech gestures), but also for conceptual reasons.},

Extant dynamic analyses must specify in the lexical entry of any operator what its 'Context Change Potential' is, and for this very reason they fail to be sufficiently explanatory. To circumvent the problem, we revise two assumptions of the dynamic approach: we take the update process to be derivative from a classical, non-dynamic semantics -- which obviates the need for dynamic lexical entries; and we deny that a local context encodes what the speech act participants 'take for granted.' Instead, we take the local context of an expression E in a sentence S to be the smallest domain that one may restrict attention to when assessing E without jeopardizing the truth conditions of S. To match the results of dynamic semantics, local contexts must be computed incrementally, using only information about the expressions that precede E. This version of the theory can be shown to be nearly equivalent to the dynamic theory of Heim 1983 -- but unlike the latter, it is entirely predictive. We also suggest that local contexts can, at some cost, be computed symmetrically, taking into account information about all of S (except E); this leads to gradient predictions, whose assessment is left for future research. doi:10.3765/sp.2.3 BibTeX info},

(i)First, we consider a special case: the speaker utters a sentence with a presupposition p which is not initially taken for granted by the addressee, but the latter takes the speaker to be an authority on the matter. Signaling the presupposition provides new information to the addressee; but it also follows from the logic of presupposition qua common belief that the presupposition is thereby satisfied (Stalnaker, Ling Philos 25(5–6):701–721, 2002). (ii) Second, we generalize this solution to other cases. We assume that even when p is common belief, there is a very small chance that the addressee might forget it (‘Fallibility’); in such cases, marking a presupposition will turn out to generate new information by re-establishing part of the original context. We also adopt from Raj Singh (Nat Lang Semantics 19(2):149–168, 2011) the hypothesis that presupposition maximization is computed relative to local contexts—and we assume that these too are subject to Fallibility; this accounts for cases in which the information that justifies the presupposition is linguistically provided. (iii) Finally, we suggest that our assumptions have benefits in the domain of implicatures: they make it possible to reinterpret Magri’s ‘blind’ (i.e. context-insensitive) implicatures as context-sensitive implicatures which just happen to be misleading.},

  abstract = {We provide the outline of a semantics for music. We take music cognition to be continuous with normal auditory cognition, and thus to deliver inferences about “virtual sources” of the music. As a result, sound parameters that trigger inferences about sound sources in normal auditory cognition produce related ones in music. But music also triggers inferences on the basis of the movement of virtual sources in tonal pitch space, which has points of stability, points of instability, and relations of attraction among them. We sketch a framework that aggregates inferences from normal auditory cognition and tonal inferences, by way of a theory of musical truth: a source undergoing a musical movement m is true of an object undergoing a series of events e just in case there is a certain structure-preserving map between m and e. This framework can help revisit aspects of musical syntax: Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s (1983) grouping structure can be seen to reflect the mereology (“partology”) of events that are abstractly represented in the music. Finally, we argue that this “refentialist” approach to music semantics still has the potential to provide an account of diverse emotional effects in music.},

For instance, If John is realistic, he knows that he is incompetent is predicted to have the presupposition that if John is realistic, he is incompetent, whereas one certainly infers that John is in fact incompetent. We summarize some difficulties faced by three solutions, DRT, Singh’s ‘Formal Alternatives’, and Singh’s ‘Interacting Alternatives’; we then offer a new analysis which is compatible with several semantic theories of projection, and which does not require the addition of a new representational module. In essence, we obtain unconditional inferences by assuming that speakers may ignore certain parts of a sentence when they accommodate a presupposition—presumably to simplify their computational work. They do so by adding to the context an assumption that would satisfy the presupposition of the sentence no matter which meaning some of its elements have. Depending on which elements are ignored in this way, a variety of strengthened presuppositions are obtained. We speculate on a possible mechanism (which follows some of Singh’s earlier ideas) to determine which of these strengthened inferences are in fact obtained. The analysis correctly predicts some new instances of the Proviso Problem in quantificational examples.},

We argue that this ‘dynamic turn’ was misguided, and that it leads straight into a dilemma: either one follows Stalnaker in his pragmatic analysis, in which case one obtains a beautiful analysis of presupposition projection in conjunctions, but not of much else; or one follows Heim in her semantic analysis, which yields broader empirical coverage but little explanatory depth (no predictions are made about connectives whose Context Change Potential was not stipulated to begin with). We sketch an alternative account, entirely developed within classical logic. We argue that in some cases a complex meaning m is conceptualized as involving a precondition p, with m=pp′ (Division). In this case a pragmatic principle, Be Articulate!, requires that if possible m should be expressed as a conjunction p and pp′ rather than as pp′ (in order to make explicit the special status of the pre-condition p). If so, why can pp′ ever be pronounced on its own? Because a principle of Minimization sometimes rules out the full conjunction p and pp′, leaving pp′ as the sole contender.},

  abstract = {While presuppositions are often thought to be lexically encoded, researchers have repeatedly argued for ‘triggering algorithms’ that productively classify certain entailments as presuppositions. We provide new evidence for this position and sketch a novel triggering rule. On the empirical side, we show that presuppositions are productively generated from iconic expressions (such as gestures) that one may not have seen before, which suggests that a triggering algorithm is indeed called for. Turning to normal words, we show that sometimes a presupposition p is triggered by a simple or complex expression that does not even entail p: it is only when contextual information guarantees that the entailment goes through that the presupposition emerges. On standard theories, this presupposition could not be hardwired, because if so it should make itself felt (by way of projection or accommodation) in all cases. Rather, a triggering algorithm seems to take as an input a contextual meaning, and to turn some contextual entailments into presuppositions. On the theoretical side, we propose that an entailment q (possibly a contextual one) of an expression qq’ is treated as a presupposition if q is an epistemic precondition of the global meaning, in the following sense: usually, when one learns that qq’ (e.g. x stops q-ing), one antecedently knows that q (e.g. x q-ed). Presuppositions thus arise from an attempt to ensure that information that is cognitively inert in general experience is also trivial relative to its linguistic environment. On various analyses, q is trivial in its linguistic environment just in case q is entailed by its local context; this provides a direct link between presupposition generation and presupposition projection. (An appendix discusses the relation between this proposal and an alternative one in terms of entailments that are in some sense counterfactually stable.)},

I argue that such cases represent a problem for existing accounts of cumulativity, because the required cumulative relation cannot be formed. I then motivate and propose an alternative analysis where all plural expressions are interpreted in situ: I expand the ‘plural projection’ framework put forth by Haslinger \&amp; Schmitt (2018, 2019), Schmitt (2019), where embedded pluralities ‘project’ to the denotations of higher nodes in the sense that the latter reflect the part-structure of the former and where cumulativity is derived via a compositional rule in a step-by-step fashion. I show that if the denotations of the plurals with the de dicto construal are analyzed as pluralities of individual concepts, which project in the afore-mentioned sense to pluralities of propositions, the data can be explained straightforwardly. This proposal differs from treatments in terms of collective belief that don’t appeal to pluralities of propositions ( Pasternak 2018a, b), in that it (i) arguably generalizes to a larger number of examples and (ii) links grammatical plurality in the embedded clause to the availability of cumulative readings.},

The point of departure is the observation that definite plural DPs and and-coordinations with coordinates of several semantic categories share certain features — in particular cumulativity—in the context of other plural expressions. Existing analyses of conjunction fail to derive these parallels and I propose that and-coordinations should be analyzed as denoting pluralities (of whatever kind of semantic object their conjuncts denote). This, in turn, raises the question of how pluralities combine with other material in the sentence. I show that a simple expansion of the standard analysis thereof, which puts the workload onto the predicate, is insufficient. I propose an alternative which is based on the idea that all semantic domains contain pluralities and involves plural projection. In this system, the truth-conditions of sentences containing plurality-denoting expressions are not due to the semantic expansion of the predicate (as in existing analyses), but the result of a step-by-step process: Once a plurality enters the derivation, the node immediately dominating it will also denote a plurality, namely of the values obtained by a particular combination of the plurality and the denotation of its sister.

Should narrow focus exhaustivity inferences be actually based on Bayesian inference involving prior probabilities of states, RSA models should predict a dependency of exhaustivity on these factors.

Bott and Noveck (2004) provided Reaction Time evidence for such a delay, replicated in a number of later variations of their study (e.g., Bott et al., 2012). Breheny et al. (2006) found corresponding delays in self-paced reading. More recently, the issue has been investigated using the visual world paradigm, where results have been more mixed. Huang and Snedeker (2009, and subsequent work) have found delays for eye movements based on the ‘not all’ implicature of ‘some.’ But various others, (e.g., Grodner et al. (2010), Breheny et al. (2013), and Degen and Tanenhaus (2011)), report results which they argue show that implicatures are available immediately. Schwarz et al. (2015) added another angle to this picture, by using a sentence picture matching task using a Covered Picture (or Covered Box; henceforth CB; Huang et al., 2013), that allowed RT comparisons both within acceptance (target) and rejection (CB) responses. While replicating the delay for implicature-based rejection responses, they find the reverse pattern for acceptance responses, with faster RTs for implicature-compatible conditions. They propose that delays associated with literal acceptances and implicature-based rejections result from a conflict between the two possible interpretations, rather than reflecting a cost of implicature-calculation. ~The present experiment extends this approach beyond RTs by combining Visual World eye-tracking with the CB paradigm. The results a) are consistent with the notion that both literal and implicature interpretations are available in par-allel; b) show that literal acceptances are nonetheless only provided reluctantly, presumably due to a preference for implicature meanings, in line with Schwarz et al’s proposal; and c) suggest that for both literal acceptances and implicature-based rejections, there is a competition effect between the two interpretations. In addition, the RT data display an implicature-based block-priming effect, suggesting that the resolution of this conflict can be sped up through repeated task-exposure.},

We argue that this complexity filter on alternatives falls short of solving the symmetry problem completely, and in fact is incompatible with the full range of observed implicatures. We propose a solution to the symmetry problem that, in addition to contextual relevance, appeals to a blocking condition: enriching the meaning of an utterance φ with an implicature is blocked if the same meaning can be expressed without this implicature, by an utterance that is no more complex than φ. In making our case, we also argue against a central auxiliary assumption that Katzir and Fox’s account appeals to, viz. the assumption that symmetry cannot be resolved by context.},

The key idea is that when the domain of a quantifier is reduced to a singleton set, it becomes effectively scopeless. Indefinites, on this view, are freer than other quantifiers to make use of this option. I argue that alternative accounts which put the action in the semantics or the syntax of indefinites still need a pragmatic mechanism of quantifier domain restriction, so that to demonstrate the necessity for such approaches, one needs to explain why domain restriction down to singletons is not possible.There is an intuition that indefinites have specific readings in which they are referential and where the speaker can identify the referent, but the hearer cannot. In the final section of the paper, I try to make sense of that intuition in the context of a theory in which indefinites are apt to have singleton domains. I arrive at the conclusion that it is a symptom of a more general phenomenon whereby contextual parameters can be relativized to bearers of propositional attitudes.},

Our theory is an extension of Shan’s (2002) account of multiple-wh questions, combining continuations (Barker, 2002) and dynamic type-shifting. Like other continuation-based analyses, but unlike most other treatments of crossover or superiority, our analysis is directly compositional (in the sense of, e.g., Jacobson, 1999). In particular, it does not postulate a level of Logical Form or any other representation distinct from surface syntax. One advantage of using continuations is that they are the standard tool for modeling order-of-evaluation in programming languages. This provides us with a natural and independently motivated characterization of what it means to evaluate expressions from left to right. We give a combinatory categorial grammar that models the syntax and the semantics of quantifier scope and wh-question formation. It allows quantificational binding but not crossover, in-situ wh but not superiority violations. In addition, the analysis automatically accounts for a variety of sentence types involving binding in the presence of pied piping, including reconstruction cases such as Whose criticism of hisimother did each personiresent?},

In this thesis, I challenge this standard approach through discussion of sentences whose semantics cannot be correctly captured in this manner, and develop an alternative, novel approach that employs Lebesgue integration. The first chapter is centered around Musan's (1995) generalization that states that the temporal (situational) interpretation of a non-presuppositional (i.e. existential) noun phrase is obligatorily dependent on that of the main predicate. It defends the view that the situational dependence is obtained by virtue of being in the scope of some operator and argues that in order to obtain the correct interpretation of plural non-presuppositional noun phrases, the numeral part of non-presuppositional noun phrases must be separated and interpreted above the said operator. The second, and last chapter incorporates the result of the former chapter into Krifka's (1990) analysis of the readings of existential sentences which Krifka terms event-related readings. After we observe that Musan's generalization is extended to the situational interpretation of units of measurement, it becomes evident that a proper semantic analysis of sentences that describe continuous production or consumption of mass entities requires the capability of treating infinitesimally small time intervals.},

  abstract = {Two generally agreed upon characteristics of presuppositions are projection and backgroundedness. Yet, presuppositions sometimes fail to project. To derive the necessary local interpretations, standard semantic local accommodation accounts posit an operation that, inside the scope of an embedding operator, turns content lexically marked as presupposed into non-backgrounded content and conjoins it with the clause’s entailed content (Heim 1983). Such accounts, as well as syntactic operator accounts descended from them (Beaver and Krahmer 2001), predict that locally accommodated presuppositions differ from projecting presuppositions in lacking not just projectivity, but also the second basic presuppositional property of backgroundedness. Recent pragmatic accounts arrive at a parallel prediction via their claim that all and only backgrounded material projects (Simons et al. 2010; Tonhauser et al. 2018). To date, though, this prediction, that non-projecting presuppositional content is also not backgrounded, has not been systematically tested, perhaps due to challenges in testing embedded material for backgroundedness directly. Using reduced cognitive salience as a proxy for presuppositional backgroundedness in a picture-matching task (Schwarz 2016), we test indirectly for differences in backgroundedness among the locally accommodated presupposition of 'also', its explicit, non-backgrounded conjunction paraphrase as posited by semantic/syntactic accounts, and equivalent non-presuppositional elisions. Standard local accommodation accounts predict equivalence among these three constructions. However, in two experiments, we find, to the contrary, that locally interpreted content contributed by also reflects greater presuppositional backgroundedness than equivalent explicit entailed content and, to a lesser degree, than more surface-similar elisions. Our task elicits a similar pattern with examples including global, rather than local, accommodation, supporting parallel backgroundedness across these cases. We briefly discuss the theoretical implications of these findings in general terms.},

More particularly, children are expected to first acquire wh-interrogatives, then wh-conditionals, correlatives, and free relatives, and finally (light-)headed relatives. The working hypothesis is set against the background of what could be considered the null hypothesis, namely that children's production matches the adult input.

This distinction predicts that it is conversationally more appropriate to assert implausible information rather than presuppose it (e.g., von Fintel, 2008; Heim, 1992; Stalnaker, 2002). A second view rejects the assumption that presuppositions are accommodated; instead, presuppositions are assimilated into asserted content and both are correspondingly open to challenge (e.g., Gazdar, 1979; van der Sandt, 1992). Under this view, we should not expect to find a difference in conversational appropriateness between asserting implausible information and presupposing it. To distinguish between these two views of linguistic information, we performed two self-paced reading experiments with an on-line stops-making-sense judgment. The results of the two experiments—using the presupposition triggers the and too—show that accommodation is inappropriate (makes less sense) relative to non-presuppositional controls when the presupposed information is implausible but not when it is plausible. These results provide support for the first view of linguistic information: the contrast in implausible contexts can only be explained if there is a presupposition-assertion distinction and accommodation is a mechanism dedicated to reasoning about presuppositions.},

  abstract = {We present evidence that preschool children oftentimes understand disjunctive sentences as if they were conjunctive. The result holds for matrix disjunctions as well as disjunctions embedded under every. At the same time, there is evidence in the literature that children understand or as inclusive disjunction in downward-entailing contexts. We propose to explain this seemingly conflicting pattern of results by assuming that the child knows the inclusive disjunction semantics of or, and that the conjunctive inference is a scalar implicature. We make two assumptions about implicature computation in the child: (i) that children access only a proper subset of the adult alternatives (specifically, they do not access the lexicon when generating alternatives), and (ii) that children possess the adult capacity to strengthen sentences with implicatures. As a consequence, children are expected to sometimes not compute any implicatures at all, but in other cases they are expected to compute an implicature that is different from the adult implicature. We argue that the child’s conjunctive strengthening of disjunctive sentences realizes the latter possibility: the adult infers that the conjunction is false but the child infers that the conjunction is true. This behaviour is predicted when our assumptions about child development are coupled with the assumption that a covert exhaustive operator is responsible for strengthening in both the child and the adult. Specifically, children’s conjunctive strengthening is predicted to follow from the same mechanism used by adults to compute conjunctive free choice implicatures in response to disjunctive permission sentences (recursive exhaustification). We furthermore argue that this parallel between the child and the adult extends to disambiguation preferences. In particular, we present evidence that children prefer to strengthen disjunctions to conjunctions, in matrix and embedded positions (under every); this result mirrors previous findings that adults prefer to compute free choice, at the root and under every. We propose a disambiguation strategy that explains the preference for conjunctive strengthening – by both the child and the adult – even though there is no general preference for exhaustification. Specifically, we propose that the preference for a conjunctive strengthening follows from a pragmatic preference for a complete answer to the Question Under Discussion.},

Gazdar (Pragmatics, Academic Press, NY, 1979) observed that scalar implicatures can obviate the constraint. For instance, sentences of the form (A or B) or (Both Aand B) are felicitous due to the exclusivity implicature of the first disjunct: A or B implicates ‘not (A and B)’. Chierchia, Fox, and Spector (Handbook of semantics, 2008) use the obviation of Hurford’s Constraint in these cases to argue for a theory of local implicature. I present evidence indicating that the constraint needs to be modified in two ways. First, implicatures can obviate Hurford’s Constraint only in earlier disjuncts, not later ones: \#(Both A and B) or (A or B). Second, the constraint rules out not only disjuncts that stand in an entailment relation, but also disjuncts that are even mutually consistent: \#John is from Russia or Asia. I propose to make sense of these facts by providing an incremental evaluation procedure which checks that each new disjunct to the right is inconsistent with the information to its left, before the disjunct can be strengthened by local implicature.},

I argue for claim (1) in Chapter 2 by arguing that Heim's principle of Maximize Presupposition! should be checked in local contexts (Local MP). In Chapter 3, I use Local MP to account for an array of blocking effects. We will see that Local MP can help to shed light on the semantics of only, counterfactual conditionals, and focus interpretation, as well as highlighting the importance of dynamically changing assignment functions in a theory of interpretation. I argue for claims (2)-(4) in Chapters 4 and 5 by attempting to address the proviso problem (Geurts [43]), as well as a new puzzle for the theory of implicature that arises in the study of attitude ascriptions.},

Though there has been recent progress on formal theories of events, these theories do not address certain syntactic and semantic properties peculiar to languages such as Hindi. This paper concentrates on properties related to perfectivity. It motivates a small number of semantic features for events and their objects, such as whether an object exists independently of an event, whether it is totally affected by the event, and so on. It then formalizes these features. It also shows how they can be formalized in an algebraic framework and applied in a categorial grammar to derive the properties of verbal and nominal predicates. The result is an integration of descriptive semantics with algebraic theories of objects and events.},

  abstract = {Utterances such as "Megan ate some of the cupcakes" are often interpreted as "Megan ate some but not all of the cupcakes". Such an interpretation is thought to arise from a pragmatic inference called scalar implicature (SI). Preschoolers typically fail to spontaneously generate SIs without the assistance of training or context that make the stronger alternative salient. However, the exact role of alternatives in generating SIs remains contested. Specifically, it is not clear whether children have difficulty with spontaneously generating possible informationally stronger scalemates, or with considering how alternatives might be relevant. We present three studies with English-speaking 5-year-olds and adults designed to address these questions. We show that (a) the accessibility of the stronger alternative is important for children's SI generation (Experiment 1); (b) the explicit presence of the stronger alternative leads children to generate SIs only when the stronger scalar term can easily be seen as relevant (Experiment 2); and (c) in contexts that establish relevant alternatives, the explicit presence of the stronger alternative is not necessary (Experiment 3). We conclude that children's considerations of lexical alternatives during SI-computation include an important role for conversational relevance. We also show that this more nuanced approach to the role of lexical alternatives in pragmatic inference unifies previously unconnected findings about children's early pragmatic development and bears on major accounts proposed to date for children's problems with SIs.},

Making use of the notion of speaker presupposition and common ground (Stalnaker 1998, 1999, 2002), I propose an analysis of sentential -le whereby the “change of state” interpretation is associated with a change expressed by propositions within a common ground, while the “contrary to expectation” interpretation is associated with a change expressed by propositions across common grounds. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, both the “change of state” and the “contrary to expectation” interpretations involve changes across a temporal domain. The proposal is supported by a restriction in the occurrence of sentential -le with downward-entailing quantifiers. The analysis supports Löbner’s (1989) insight that already/schon is associated with a presupposition about a prior “negative state”, and clarifies how the “change of state” associated with sentential -le is different from the one entailed by the occurrence of a telic situation.},

In a nutshell, I claim that a bare plural noun like horses denotes the set of individuals, be they atomic or complex, whose atomic parts are individual horses, and that the at-least-two-reading that one gets in sentences such as John has seen horses in the garden is an implicature that derives from the comparison of this sentence with John has seen a horse in the garden. In terms of its literal meaning, the latter sentence is true if and only if John has seen at least one horse in the garden, but gets pragmatically strengthened into John has seen exactly one horse in the garden (scalar implicature). As a result, John has seen horses in the garden will implicate the negation of John has seen exactly one horse in the garden, so that it will end up meaning John has seen several horses. I give an explicit formalization of the processes that lead to higher-order implicatures, based on the possibility of iterating an exhaustivity operator. The proposal accounts for the readings of plural indefinites in various linguistic contexts (monotone-decreasing contexts, non-monotonic contexts, and universally quantified contexts).},

Solt proposed an ingenious account based on certain assumptions about the meaning of 'about' and principles of language use, and, specifically, the fact that 'about' is an approximator that manipulates a granularity parameter. I argue that the pattern uncovered by Solt is not specifically tied to approximators, as it can be reproduced with disjunctions of numerals and interval-denoting expressions ('between n and m'), and is therefore part of a broader generalization. I offer an account based on (a) the universal density of measurement scales (Fox and Hackl 2006), (b) a semantic analysis of degree constructions that involves in a crucial way the notion of 'maximal informativity' (Buccola and Spector 2016, with roots in Rullmann 1995; Fox and Hackl 2006; Schlenker 2012; von Fintel et al. 2014) and (c) a pragmatic ban on redundant numerical expressions.

The goal of this paper is to propose a multivalent framework which can deal simultaneously with presupposition and vagueness, and, more specifically, capture their projection properties as well as their different roles in language. Now, there is a prima facie simple way of doing this, which simply consists in assimilating the two phenomena, and using an appropriate type of trivalent logic. On this view, we just need a compositional system that deals with the ‘undefined’ truth-value, and does not care about whether the source of undefinedness is ‘presuppositional’ or related to vagueness. I will argue that such a simple solution cannot succeed, and point out a number of desiderata that any successful approach must meet. I will then present and discuss two seven-valued semantics, inspired, respectively, by the Strong Kleene semantics and by supervaluationism, which meet these desiderata.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, I discuss and criticize an argument put forward by Giorgio Magri in a number of recent papers (Magri 2009, 2011) supporting the view that scalar implicature computation is an automatic process that is blind to contextual information — a view that does not seem consistent with Gricean accounts of scalar implicatures.* My main argument is that the data that Magri uses as evidence for the blindness view are part of broader generalizations that Magri’s account does not capture. I suggest an alternative account for one of the relevant generalizations. In the course of the discussion, I also show that Magri’s approach faces a number of empirical problems.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a new theory of donkey anaphora that does not include any dynamic component. Even if the approach is not dynamic, it retains a key aspect of the dynamic tradition, namely the view that information states include not just factual information about the world, but also information about discourse referents, e.g., variables. It also makes crucial use of plural assignment functions (sets of standard assigments, cf. van der Berg 1996; Nouwen 2003; Brasoveanu 2008). Unlike dynamic approaches, sentences are evaluated as true or false relative to a pair (w, G), where w is a possible world and G is a plural assignment, with no reference to contexts or information states, and compositional semantics does not refer in any way to context update. In order to predict adequate meanings and felicity conditions, I combine two ingredients that have been used to account for presupposition projection, namely Trivalence (Peters 1979; Beaver and Krahmer 2001) and Schlenker’s Transparency Principle(Schlenker 2007, 2008). Two ideas play a crucial role in the proposal. First, a sentence such as ‘Shex came’ comes with the presupposition that the variable x is ‘valued’ by the assignment function G, which means that every atomic assignment in G maps x to the same value. Second I adopt Mandelkern’s (2002) witness condition: an existential statement such as ‘Someonex came’ is undefined in (w, G) if it is classically true in w but G does not map x to a witness of the existential statement. Importantly, undefinedness is not equated with Presupposition Failure (e.g., even though ‘Someonex came’ can be undefined, it is in fact never a presupposition failure). Rather, presupposition projection is governed by Schlenker’s (2007,2008) Transparency Principle: the presupposition ‘x is valued’ should be redundant in the syntactic position in which ‘Shex came’ occurs.},

Free variables are the counterparts of syntactically unbound pronouns, and existential quanti fiers those of singular indefinites.},

Although previous studies have compared small samples of informal and formal results, this article presents the first large-scale comparison based on a random sample of phenomena from a leading theoretical journal (Linguistic Inquiry). We tested 296 data points from the approximately 1743 English data points that were published in Linguistic Inquiry between 2001 and 2010. We tested this sample with 936 naïve participants using three formal judgment tasks (magnitude estimation, 7-point Likert scale, and two-alternative forced-choice) and report five statistical analyses. The results suggest a convergence rate of 95\% between informal and formal methods, with a margin of error of 5.3–5.8\%. We discuss the implications of this convergence rate for the ongoing conversation about judgment collection methods, and lay out a set of questions for future research into syntactic methodology.},

Participants observe game scenarios with four open cards on the table and two closed cards outside of the table, while listening to statements made by a virtual player. In the full access context, the player makes a fully informed statement by referring only to the open cards, as {$<$}italic{$>$}cards on the table{$<$}/italic{$>$}; in the partial access context, she makes a partially informed statement by referring to the whole set of cards, as {$<$}italic{$>$}cards in the game{$<$}/italic{$>$}. If all of the open cards contain a given object X (Fullset condition), then {$<$}italic{$>$}some cards on the table contain Xs{$<$}/italic{$>$} is inconsistent with the {$<$}italic{$>$}not all{$<$}/italic{$>$} reading, whereas it is unknown whether {$<$}italic{$>$}some cards in the game contain X{$<$}/italic{$>$} is consistent with this reading. If only a subset of the open cards contains X (Subset condition), then both utterances are known to be consistent with the {$<$}italic{$>$}not all{$<$}/italic{$>$} implicature. Differential effects are observed depending on the quantifier reading adopted by the participant: For those participants who adopt the {$<$}italic{$>$}not all{$<$}/italic{$>$} reading in the full access context, but not in the partial access context (weak pragmatic reading), a late posterior negativity effect is observed in the partial access context for the Fullset relative to the Subset condition. This effect is argued to reflect inference-driven context retrieval and monitoring processes related to epistemic reasoning involved in evaluating the competence assumption. By contrast, for participants who adopt the logical interpretation of {$<$}italic{$>$}some{$<$}/italic{$>$} ({$<$}italic{$>$}some and possibly all{$<$}/italic{$>$}), an N400 effect is observed in the partial access context, when comparing the Subset against the Fullset condition, which is argued to result from the competition between the two quantifying expressions {$<$}italic{$>$}some cards on the table{$<$}/italic{$>$} and {$<$}italic{$>$}some cards in the game{$<$}/italic{$>$} functioning in the experiment as scalar alternatives.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We close by considering some remaining issues surrounding semantically incorporated DPs in English: specifically, how weak (in) definites relate to other nominals that receive covarying interpretations across contexts—such as bare plurals on the one hand (which we do not take to be semantically incorporated) and bare singulars on the other.},

  abstract = {One traditional approach to analysing conditionals begins with the assumption that a conditional sentence has a propositional content, and tries to provide that content. Another approach holds that conditional sentences are used to perform a special kind of speech act, and the theory of conditionals should explain what is distinctive about this act. The controversy between these two approaches interacts with another controversy, namely the relationship between conditionals labeled ‘indicative’ and those labeled ‘subjunctive’. Some theorists have treated the problem of analysing indicative and subjunctive conditionals as separate problems, each to be treated on its own terms. Others have sought some kind of unified analysis. This chapter attempts to clarify what is at stake in the debate between truth-conditional and non-truth-conditional accounts, focusing on the case of indicative conditional assertions. More generally, it seeks to clarify the relation between speech acts and the propositions and propositional attitudes that are expressed in them. The strategy here is to sketch a specific account of each kind within a common framework, and then to consider exactly how they differ. One of the conclusions is that while there are real differences between the accounts, they may be less significant than they have seemed.},

Therefore, if the butler didn’t do it, the gardener did.” This piece of reasoning — call it the direct argument — may seem tedious, but it is surely compelling. Yet if it is a valid inference, then the indicative conditional conclusion must be logically equivalent to the truth-functional material conditional,1 and this conclusion has consequences that are notoriously paradoxical. The problem is that if one accepts the validity of the intuitively reasonable direct argument from the material conditional to the ordinary indicative conditional, then one must accept as well the validity of many arguments that are intuitively absurd. Consider, for example, “the butler did it; therefore, if he didn’t, the gardener did.” The premiss of this argument entails the premiss of the direct argument, and their conclusions are the same. Therefore, if the direct argument is valid, so is this one. But this argument has no trace of intuitive plausibility. Or consider what may be inferred from the denial of a conditional. Surely I may deny that if the butler didn’t do it, the gardener did without affirming the butler’s guilt. Yet if the conditional is material, its negation entails the truth of its antecedent. It is easy to multiply paradoxes of the material conditional in this way — paradoxes that must be explained away by anyone who wants to defend the thesis that the direct argument is valid.},

First, the probability calculus is interpreted as a semantics for truth functional logic. Absolute probabilities are treated as degrees of rational belief. Conditional probabilities are explicitly defined in terms of absolute probabilities in the familiar way. Second, the probability calculus is extended in order to provide an interpretation for counterfactual probabilities--conditional probabilities where the condition has zero probability. Third, conditional propositions are introduced as propositions whose absolute probability is equal to the conditional probability of the consequent on the antecedent. An axiom system for this conditional connective is recovered from the probabilistic definition. Finally, the primary semantics for this axiom system, presented elsewhere, is related to the probabilistic interpretation.},

  abstract = {This thesis argues for a theory of neg-raising that is unified with existing theories of free choice (Fox, 2007; Bar-Lev, 2018) and negative polarity items (Crnič, 2014b, 2019b), as motivated by a case study of polarity-sensitive 'until'. I argue that this unification of neg-raising and polarity-sensitivity falls out as a natural consequence of the systems developed in this earlier work, combined with the novel assumption that the neg-raising predicates 'want', 'should', and 'supposed to' express underlying existential quantificational force, which is disguised on the surface as the result of obligatory strengthening in positive sentences due to the lack of a dual in the lexicon.    The primary empirical motivation for this view comes from a novel test that is able to diagnose the underlying existential meaning of the modal items. The test requires a negative presupposition trigger, like 'no longer', which creates a downward-entailing environment in which strengthening need not apply, but which also triggers an upward-entailing presupposition, in which the basic existential meaning can be revealed. I argue that further results of this test suggest a typology of neg-raising modals that is predicted by the analysis. I also present a study (joint work with Rachel Stacy and Athulya Aravind), in which we examine predictions of the analysis in the domain of language acquisition. We argue that the proposal receives support from experimental evidence suggesting that a population of children go through a stage of development in which all modals undergo strengthening in a similar manner to the neg-raising modals examined in this thesis.},

  abstract = {ollowing Mittwoch (1977), Iatridou and Zeijlstra (to appear), I attempt a unified account of until (which has proven challenging for reasons I discuss). I propose a basic weak meaning, which obligatorily strengthens in upward-entailing environments in a manner similar to free-choice. Infelicity then results in cases where this strengthened meaning contradicts contextual knowledge about the sentences that the until phrase modifies. I argue that this account avoids the empirical problems of previous accounts, and also provides a way to understand until’s status as a ‘strong’ NPI: Its restricted distribution in (merely) Strawson downward-entailing environments can be explained with independently motivated mechanisms governing the interaction between presuppositions and implicatures.},

  abstract = {I develop a new analysis of “weak necessity” modals should and supposed to that is motivated by novel observations of extra-weak meanings in some environments. I argue that this evidence of weak readings suggests that these modal verbs exhibit a type of variable force. Sentences with weak necessity modals express universal force in positive sentences and existential force under negation. The analysis will build on an analogy with free choice disjunction that assumes a basic weak meaning that strengthens in upward-entailing environments (Fox,2007; Bassi and Bar-Lev, 2016). I hypothesize that the precise distribution of the strengthened readings is governed by the polarity-sensitive nature of the modals (cf. Iatridou and Zeijlstra, 2013; Homer, 2015). In particular, I argue that the polarity sensitivity of the modals is the result of the association of their domains with a covert even (cf. Lahiri, 1995; Crni?c, 2014, 2019 for NPI any). This hypothesis makes intricate predictions about the range of readings that should be observed in various logical environments that I show to be borne out. I also argue that the analysis provides a natural link between neg-raising and weak necessity.},

On the proposed approach, deontic modals update preference orderings, and connectives operate on these updates rather than propositions. The success of this approach stems from its capacity to capture the difference between expressing the preferences that give rise to permissions and conveying propositions about those preferences.},

This paper presents three new challenges for a non-representational analysis, showing that the obstacles facing it are even steeper than previously appreciated. I will argue that the only way for the non-representationalist to meet these three challenges is to adopt a dynamic semantics. Such a dynamic semantics is proposed here: imperatives introduce preferences between alternatives. This characterization of meaning focuses on what function a sentence serves in discourse, rather than what that sentence refers to (e.g., a state of the world). By representing the meaning of imperatives, connectives and declaratives in a common dynamic format, the challenges posed for non-representationalism are met. BibTeX info},

This paper raises new problems for the closest thing to a uniform analysis in the literature (Stalnaker, Philosophia, 5, 269–286 (1975)) and develops a new theory which solves them. I also show that this new analysis provides an improved treatment of three phenomena (the import-export equivalence, reverse Sobel-sequences and disjunctive antecedents). While these results concern central issues in the study of conditionals, broader themes in the philosophy of language and formal semantics are also engaged here. This new analysis exploits a dynamic conception of meaning where the meaning of a symbol is its potential to change an agent’s mental state (or the state of a conversation) rather than being the symbol’s content (e.g. the proposition it expresses). The analysis of conditionals is also built on the idea that the contrast between subjunctive and indicative conditionals parallels a contrast between revising and consistently extending some body of information.},

A novel account of these two phenomena is proposed, according to which all occurrences of phi-features are both semantically and morphologically relevant. For such a ‘uniformly semantic account’ of phi-features, dependent plural pronouns constitute a theoretical challenge, while partial binding is more or less straightforwardly accounted for. In order to make sense of the semantic effects of the phi-features on dependent plural pronouns, the following idea is pursued: the phi-features on a dependent plural pronoun reflect the range of values that the pronoun takes, rather than the particular value it denotes at a time. This idea is implemented in a compositional semantics by making use of (Skolemized) choice functions. An appealing feature of the present account is that, unlike its predecessors, it accounts for dependent plural pronouns without c-commanding antecedents in essentially the same way as for those with c-commanding antecedents. It is also shown how this account of dependent plural pronouns can straightforwardly be augmented with set indices to account for partial binding.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates experimentally the role of Question-Answer Congruence (QAC, von Stechow 1990, Rooth 1985, 1992) in child language acquisition and adult sentence processing. Specifically, I present two case studies: sentences with "only" and sentences with the Rise-Fall-Rise contour (RFR, Jackendoff 1972). Case study 1 investigates a long-standing puzzle concerning the acquisition of "only." Since Crain et al. (1994), many studies report children display difficulties understanding sentences with pre-subject "only" while having no difficulty with pre-verbal "only." The current study manipulates the levels of QAC to study the puzzle. The results show that QAC plays a significant role in the asymmetry between Subject-only vs. VP-only, and more generally, both children and adults are sensitive to QAC, with congruence facilitating processing, and incongruence interfering with processing. We conclude that the cost of the accommodation of a sub-question to obey QAC is different for Subject-only and VP-only. I propose that the way information is packaged makes it easier to accommodate a set of questions asking about the object of the sentence, which makes it easier to process VP-only. We also showed that the extent to which QAC influences comprehension is different for children and adults. For children, QAC has a stronger influence than the syntactic condition on only. For adults, the syntactic condition is not violated. We suggest that the status of the syntactic condition regarding only is a factor that distinguishes children from adults in processing only. Case study 2 investigates whether children can construe the inverse scope interpretation, which children are reported to disfavor (Musolino 1998), with the RFR prosody, which is standardly taken to require inverse scope. The results show that both children and adults are sensitive to RFR and able to compute the implicature associated with RFR to disambiguate the inverse scope interpretation. As in the "only" study, QAC levels varied in the RFR experiment. However, the results revealed no effect of question type. This leaves an important open question: why QAC seems more active in children in determining the associate of only than in the determination of quantifier scope when the prosody makes the scope clear.},

In this paper, however, we argue that postulating pro is not so innocent. The most puzzling aspect of pro is its untouchability, which means that it fails to merge with any kinds of adnominal particles and modifiers, although such combination is totally possible for overt pronouns in Japanese. To derive this disparity, we claim that Japanese pro should be eliminated altogether. Specifically, based on Williams’ (2015) analysis of implicit arguments in English, we propose a pro-free syntax and a free-variable semantics for null nominal anaphora in Japanese and develop such a theory in tandem with Neo-Davidsonian Event Semantics (e.g., Parsons 1990, Landman 2000).

  abstract = {We argue for a new inference-based analysis of belief attribution in which the embedded proposition is inferable from, but need not directly identify, an underlying belief of the subject’s. The analysis accounts for attributions of belief in necessary truths and falsities, overcoming a major difficulty facing Hintikka (1962), and goes beyond Cresswell \&amp; von Stechow (1982) in accounting for intuitively valid inferable belief attributions. The analysis is based on a novel subjective I-semantics in which extensions depend dually on extension conditions assigned by a judge, and on the judge’s beliefs about what satisfies those conditions. The interpretation of believe uses syntactic inference over logical formulas, with premises deriving from beliefs of both the attributor and the attributee, and the conclusion derived from the clause embedded under believe. Unlike nearly all prior analyses of belief attribution since Hintikka, our proposal makes no commitment to possible worlds while generating de dicto, de re, de qualitate, de translato and other interpretations, with the only formal semantic ambiguity deriving from what gets raised out of the embedded clause.

  abstract = {This paper reports an investigation into the nature of Negative Polarity Item (NPI) licensing conditions from a processing perspective. We found that the processing cost of Downward Entailingness (a k a the Monotonicity Effect) is determined by the number of monotonicity reversals of NPI domains, rather than by the number of Downward-Entailing (DE) operators. This conclusion is not based on the standard judgment paradigm, but rather, on the measurement of continuous variables (error rates, Reaction Times (RTs)) in a verification task, in which the truth value of a sentence is determined against a scenario. We conducted two experiments with sentences that contained one or two DE operators, which featured in different syntactic configurations. We explored how RT is affected by the manipulation of both the number of DE operators, and the syntactic environments in which they reside. We ran these experiments in Hebrew and in English, with different participant populations and different testing methods. Despite the linguistic subtlety of the theoretical issues, our results were remarkably sharp, leading to two firm conclusions: (i) that processing time is determined not by the number of DE operators, but rather, by the monotonicity of the minimal constituent in which they reside; (ii) that DE-ness is not a property of operators, but of environments. We show how our results bear directly on the current debate about the nature of monotonicity, which we describe below. Finally, we provide quantitative tests of alternative, non-semantic explanations, and show how our results do not support them.},

  abstract = {This dissertation studies counterfactual conditionals in English. Counterfactual conditionals typically come with inferences that their antecedent and their consequent are not true in the actual world (written CF-p and CF-q, respectively).(1) If John had taken the bus, he would have been on time. CF-p: John did not take the bus CF-q: John was not on timeFocusing on CF-q, the dissertation answers the question of what contextual conditions must be met for CF-q to arise, by looking at cases in which the inference gets cancelled. I show that CF-q can be cancelled in a number of different contexts:- in some but not all conditionals that have the words 'also' or 'still' in their consequent;- in a set of conditionals when uttered with a specific intonation contour.Empirically, I show that when 'also' focus-associates with material in the antecedent, it cancels CF-q, but when it associates with material in the consequent it does not. This difference in focus association is reflected in the prosodic properties of the particle 'also' in the conditional.The first step of the analysis is to find a property that unites the different CF-q-cancellation contexts. I argue that what they have in common is their making salient more than one cause for the same consequent (a multiple cause context). In the case of 'also', association with focus determines where focus alternatives are generated, which in turn determines whether a single or multiple causes are made salient.The second step of the analysis is to show that conditional perfection (strengthening conditionals to biconditionals) is a necessary ingredient for the CF-q inference to arise, an idea sketched by Karttunen (1971). The crucial prediction is that in contexts in which no conditional perfection occurs, CF-q is not generated either.Finally, I show that multiple cause contexts do not trigger conditional perfection, which in view of the above-mentioned prediction completes the analysis. Moreover, because conditional perfection has been analyzed in terms of discourse structure and exhaustive answers, we obtain a new set of theoretical tools to study counterfactuality as a discourse phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Noveck (2001) argued that children even as old as 11 do not reliably endorse a scalar interpretation of weak scalar terms (some, might, or) (cf. Braine \& Rumain, 1981; Smith, 1980). More recent studies suggest, however, that children's apparent failures may depend on the experimental demands (Papafragou \& Musolino, 2003). Although previous studies involved children of different ages as well as different tasks, and are thus not directly comparable, nevertheless a common finding is that children do not seem to derive scalar implicatures to the same extent as adults do. The present article describes a series of experiments that were conducted with Italian speaking subjects (children and adults), focusing mainly on the scalar term some. Our goal was to carefully examine the specific conditions that allow the computation of implicatures by children. In so doing, we demonstrate that children as young as 7 (the youngest age of the children who participated in the Noveck study) are able to compute implicatures in experimental conditions that properly satisfy certain contextual prerequisites for deriving such implicatures. We also present further results that have general consequences for the research methodology employed in this area of study. Our research indicates that certain tasks mask children's understanding of scalar terms, not only including the task used by Noveck, but also tasks that employ certain explicit instructions, such as the training task used by Papafragou \& Musolino (2003). Our findings indicate further that, although explicit training apparently improves children's ability to draw implicatures, children nevertheless fail to achieve adult levels of performance for most scalar terms even in such tasks, and that the effects of instruction do not last beyond the training session itself for most children. Another relevant finding of the present study is that some of the manipulations of the experimental context have an effect on all subjects, whereas others produce effects on just a subset of children. Individual differences of this kind may have been concealed in previous research because performance by individual subjects was not reported. Our general conclusions are that even young children (7-year olds) have the prerequisites for deriving scalar implicatures, although these abilities are revealed only when the conversational background is natural.},

Assuming that tenses are composed of Reichenbachian times, I propose that these times map to the syntax in the following way: the Event time is represented in VP, the Reference time in AspP (Aspect Phrase), and the Speech time in TP (Tense Phrase). This approach makes possible a structural analysis of the ambiguity of temporal adverbs such as at 2:00. Depending on their adjunction site, temporal adverbs modify different parts of the tense structure of the clause; when adjoined to VP, they modify the Event time, and when adjoined to AspP, they modify the Reference time. The analysis of the syntax of tense offered here accounts for the correlation between the position and interpretation of the temporal discourse adverb then. The discourse representation of tense is shown to be based on the same primitives and subject to the same principles as the syntactic representation of tense. The present analysis sheds light on the temporal syntax of arguments, showing that reflexes of the syntax of tense are evident in the interpretation site of subjects at LF; subjects with gerundive relatives are interpreted in VP when the gerund is temporally dependent on the Event time of the main clause, and in TP when the gerund is dependent on the Speech time of the main clause.},

The semantic dependency that then induces between sentences in discourse is argued to be identical to the dependency that holds within sentences in temporal adjunct clause constructions.

  abstract = {Time in Natural Language investigates the relationship between the syntactic and semantic representations of sentences within the domain of tense. Assuming that tenses are semantically composed of three distinct times, Thompson proposes that these times map onto the syntax in a regular fashion: each time is associated with a unique syntactic head. Adopting the Minimalist approach to syntactic theory, this approach makes possible insightful analyses of syntactic structures involving temporal dependency. Thompson argues that, depending on their adjunction site, temporal adverbials modify different parts of the tense structure of the clause. Locating the Event time within VP, it is correctly predicted that an adverbial that modifies the Event time is adjoined to VP. On the other hand, since the Reference time is argued to be within AspP, when an adverbial is adjoined to AspP, it modifies the Reference time. The syntax of temporal adjunct clauses is accounted for in a similar fashion; they may be adjoined either to VP, where they are interpreted as simultaneous with the matrix event, or to AspP, where they are interpreted as nonsimultaneous. Thompson shows that the analysis sheds light on the less-studied issue of the temporal syntax of arguments. Subjects with gerundive relative clauses are claimed to be interpreted in VP at LF when the relative clause is temporally dependent on the Event time of the main clause, and in TP when the relative clause is dependent on the Speech time of the main clause. By extending the syntactic proposal to investigate the discourse-level effects of tense, an original analysis of the discourse representation of tense is proposed. Thompson argues that the discourse representation of tense is based on same primitives and subject to the same principles as the syntactic representation of tense, based on an in-depth examination of the structure and meaning of the temporal discourse adverb then .},

  abstract = {A sentence containing disjunction in the scope of a possibility modal, such as Angie is allowed to buy the boat or the car, gives rise to the free choice inference that Angie can freely choose between the two. This inference poses a well-known puzzle, in that it is not predicted by a standard treatment of modals and disjunction (e.g., Kamp (Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 74:57–74, 1974)). To complicate things further, free choice tends to disappear under negation: Angie is not allowed to buy the boat or the car doesn’t merely convey the negation of free choice, but rather the stronger double prohibition reading that Angie cannot buy either one. There are two main approaches to the free choice-double prohibition pattern in the literature. While they both capture the relevant data points, they make a testable, divergent prediction regarding the status of positive and negative sentences in a context in which Angie can only buy one of the two objects, e.g., the boat. In particular, the implicature-based approach (e.g., Fox (Presupposition and implicature in compositional semantics, pp.~71–120, 2007); Klinedinst (Plurality and possibility, PhD diss., UCLA, 2007); Bar-Lev and Fox (Proceedings of SALT 27, pp.~95–115, 2017); Bar-Lev and Fox (Natural Language Semantics 28:175–223, 2020)) predicts that the positive sentence is true in such a context, but associated with a false implicature, while it predicts the negative sentence to be straightforwardly false. The homogeneity-based approach in Goldstein (Semantics \& Pragmatics 12:1–53, 2019) predicts both the positive and negative sentences to be equally undefined (see also Aloni (Semantics \& Pragmatics 15:5, 2022); Willer (Proceedings of the 21st Amsterdam Colloquium, pp.~511–520, 2017)) for similar predictions). Investigating the contrast between these sentences in such a context therefore provides a clear way to address the debate between implicature and non-implicature accounts of free choice. We present a set of four experiments aiming to do just this, by comparing free choice inferences to regular implicatures, using a ternary judgment task. The results overall present a challenge for the implicature approach. We discuss how the implicature approach could be amended to account for our results, based on a recent proposal by Enguehard and Chemla (Linguistics \& Philosophy 44:79–112, 2021) on the distribution of implicatures.},

  abstract = {A sentence containing disjunction in the scope of a possibility modal, such as Angie is allowed to buy the boat or the car, gives rise to the FREE CHOICE~inference that Angie can freely choose between the two. This inference poses a well-known puzzle, in that it is not predicted by a standard treatment of modals and disjunction (e.g., Kamp 1974). To complicate things further, FREE CHOICE~tends to disappear under negation: Angie is not allowed to buy the boat or the~car doesn't merely convey the negation of free choice, but rather the stronger~DUAL PROHIBITION reading that Angie cannot buy either one. There are two main approaches to the FREE CHOICE-DUAL PROHIBITION pattern in the literature. While they both capture the relevant data points, they make a testable, divergent prediction regarding the status of positive and negative sentences in a context in which Angie can only buy one of the two objects, e.g., the boat. In particular, the implicature-based~approach (e.g., Fox 2007; Klinedinst 2007; Bar-Lev \&amp; Fox 2017) predicts that~the positive sentence is true in such a context, but associated with a false implicature, while it predicts the~ negative sentence to be straightforwardly false.

  abstract = {Plural morphology in English is associated with a multiplicity inference. For example, “Emily fed giraffes” is typically interpreted to mean that Emily fed multiple giraffes. It has long been observed that this inference disappears in downward-entailing linguistic environments, such as in the scope of negation. For example, “Emily didn't feed giraffes” does not merely suggest that she didn't feed multiple giraffes, but rather that she didn't feed any. There are three main approaches to explaining this puzzle: the first proposes that the plural is ambiguous, and invokes a preference for stronger meanings; the second derives multiplicity inferences as implicatures; and the third provides a homogeneity-based account. These different approaches can all account for the interpretation of the plural across upward- and downward-entailing environments. They differ, however, in what they predict for three further aspects of the plural: the status of positive and negative plural sentences in singular contexts, children's acquisition of plural meanings, and the relationship between plural meanings and scalar implicatures. In this paper, we report on three experiments investigating adults' and preschool-aged children's interpretation of plural morphology in English. The experiments reveal that participants distinguish positive and negative plural sentences presented in singular contexts, and that adults assign a different status to these positive and negative sentences. It is also observed that children, unlike adults, tend to accept underinformative positive plural sentences in singular contexts — in parallel with their behavior on standard scalar implicatures — while they are relatively more adult-like when it comes to negative plural sentences in the same contexts, showing a tendency to reject the negative sentences. We discuss how the findings of the three experiments are expected on a scalar implicature approach to multiplicity inferences, and the open challenges they pose for the ambiguity and homogeneity approaches.},

Traditionally, contrastive topic is analyzed as an independent information-structural notion that is linked to a particular interpretation and intonation. The paper, however, argues that the information-structural notion of contrastive topic is redundant and can be reduced to that of contrastive focus. The apparent dissimilarity between contrastive topics and contrastive foci is attributed to a difference in the structures that contain them rather than any particular difference between the associated information-structural notions themselves. The structures that host contrastive topics and contrastive foci are claimed to be distinct due to the nature of an additional focused element obligatorily present in the sentence. Contrastive topics and contrastive foci themselves, in contrast, are shown to be associated with identical interpretations, which results in their identical syntactic distribution, strongly suggesting that they in fact represent one and the same information-structural phenomenon in two different types of construction.},

The majority of the empirical data discussed in the chapter come from Japanese, in which contrastive topics receive proto‐typical focus accents and the particle (‐wa) that signals a sentence topic must be employed. The proposed analysis derives the pragmatic effect of contrastive topics by making use of the contribution of focus accents, the function of the topic particle, and pragmatic inference based on the Gricean reasoning. A variety of consequences and implications of the analysis are also addressed.},

  abstract = {This dissertation provides solutions for some problems of quantification and anaphora interpretation in VP ellipsis contexts. The introductory Chapter 1 begins with brief descriptions of the problems and some of the basic assumptions employed in this thesis. I will then discuss the 'identity problem' of VP ellipsis and argue that the relevant identity condition for VPs is determined at the level of LF but is oblivious to indices on anaphoric expressions. This conclusion leads to a question of how to constrain indexing of pronominal elements in VP ellipsis contexts so that unavailable interpretations are successfully eliminated. In Chapter 2, I argue that the distribution of indices in VP ellipsis contexts is constrained by a pragmatic principle, namely a principle of focus interpretation. It will be shown that some of the most recent development in the semantics and pragmatics of focus gives the right degree of restrictiveness on indexing. Chapter 3 is an investigation of a curious puzzle of quantifier scope in VP ellipsis contexts. When a quantificational NP is contained in the antecedent VP, its interpretation appears to be dependent on the quantificational structure of the ellipsis site. I will argue that the unavailable interpretations of quantifiers in those contexts are ruled out because they do not satisfy the condition of focus interpretation. The solution advocated here removes the need for special syntactic constraints on scope taking in ellipsis contexts. The core empirical issue in Chapter 4 is a set of examples in which a pronoun in VP ellipsis contexts allows a so-called 'sloppy' reading in a structural configuration that is believed to disallow variable binding. These examples threaten the standard view that a strict reading of a pronoun is brought about by the referential nature of the pronoun while a bound variable pronoun yields a sloppy reading under ellipsis. I will provide a solution for this puzzle, in which I will relate the problem to the semantics of indefinite NPs and pronouns anaphoric to them.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a pragmatic account for what have come to be known as logical form (LF) intervention effects, based on a wide range of data from Japanese and Korean. Despite their appearance, these effects are not due to structural constraints operative at LF but rather to a less-than-perfect realization of the information structure of interrogative sentences. The potential interveners, which seem to be a random collection of various expressions, are classified as Anti-Topic Items, since they cannot bear the topic marker -wa/(n)un. Although the non-Wh material in a Wh-question must belong to old information, the interveners fail to be interpreted as background material because of their Anti-Topicality when they precede Wh-phrases. The cancellation of the intervention effects with scrambling is derived from the prosodic phrasing that scrambling creates. Moving a Wh-element over an intervener places the intervener in the position of post-focus reduction—a prosodically reduced portion of the sentence. With post-focus reduction, the intervener becomes a part of old information. It will be shown that the proposed analysis not only accounts for core cases of intervention effects, but also makes correct predictions concerning the matrix-subordinate contrast in intervention effects and the special status of negative polarity items (NPIs).},

In my previous work (Tomioka 2010), I argued that CTs always involve contrasted speech acts, and this paper presents further evidence for this hypothesis by closely examining how CTs and foci interact. The proposed analysis leads to a new set of questions, one of which is how a focus and a CT are distinguished when they appear simultaneously in one sentence. I argue that a focus is subjected both to the exhaustifying operation at the level of proposition and to the set-generating operation at the level of speech act whereas a CT must be spared from the exhaustification below speech act. The differentiation is achieved via the ‘selective binding’ approach to association with focus proposed by Wold (1996).},

  abstract = {This dissertation looks at the dual lives of wh-phrases in Vietnamese, namely their syntax-semantic behavior in interrogative and non-interrogative contexts. It is a common idea, since Nishigauchi (1986), and Cheng (1991), that wh-phrases are variables without any quantificational force, but obtain their interpretations from their binders. However, I argue that Hamblin (1973) semantics as revived by Kratzer \&Shimoyama (2002) (henceforth neo-Hamblin semantics) is more plausible in that it allows us to maintain a uniform denotation of wh-phrases, and, at the same time to account for their apparent various quantificational interpretations. Chapter I presents a brief review of quantification theories and wh-quantification in Vietnamese. Chapter II is concerned with Vietnamese syntax. In this chapter, I investigate Vietnamese nominal and clausal structures and various topics in the nominal and clausal domains. Particularly, I am concerned with nominal and clausal structures of Vietnamese, aspect and tense particles, and sentential final particles. I also examine various operations such as topicalization, relativization, and scopal interaction between negation and quantification operators. This chapter serves as a basic preparation for the discussion in the following chapters. Chapter III explores one aspect of the non-interrogative life of wh-phrases, namely when they obtain universal interpretations. When a wh-phrase associates locally or non-locally with cũng, a focus sensitive particle, a universal interpretation arises. I propose that in local cases this focus sensitive particle is head of a Focus Phrase in overt syntax that requires a focused element in its Spec. The focus particle is a universal quantifier that takes a propositional alternative set as its argument, which yields a universal interpretation. I argue that the non-local association between a wh-phrase and this particle is only apparent given that this particle is not obligatory and its presence adds a concessive flavor. I therefore propose that a universal interpretation in non-local contexts derives from a covert universal quantifier over situations. Chapter IV continues with the non-interrogative life of wh-phrases with a discussion of existential interpretations of wh-phrases. I hold that existential interpretations arise from the existential closure by alternative set-taking operators. The availability of these operators is subject to licensing. The requirement that a licensor must c-command its licensee, but does not need to be clause-mate with it, fits into the picture of neo-Hamblin semantics. In addition, a wh-phrase can form a constituent with a particle. This constituent does not need licensing and can take any scope. I propose that the existential interpretation of this constituent is derived from the existential closure of a choice function variable introduced by the particle. Chapter V looks into the interrogative life of wh-phrases. Wh-questions in Vietnamese employ two strategies: LF movement and non-movement. LF movement is required by the Hamblin interpretative mechanism: A wh-phrase must undergo LF movement to Spec, CP to stop the alternative set introduced by the wh-phrase from expanding. When a question operator is available, namely, when it is licensed by a wh-particle, no movement is needed: The propositional alternative set is captured by this operator, through which a question reading obtains. Chapter VI summarizes the main points in the five chapters and indicates what this dissertation contributes to the field. I hold that it is universal that wh-phrases denote sets of in individual alternatives. Their quantificational forces derive from the operators that capture alternative sets. Languages differ with respect to what type of operators is used. With respect to wh-questions we propose that overt movement is purely syntactic, and it is universal that wh-in-situ languages do not employ covert movement. The covert movement in Vietnamese is language specific. Finally, I offer an account for the island effects in Vietnamese from the perspective of language acquisition.},

Various observations about the restriction of already and yet to certain tenses and aspects, and about their failure to match with many adverbs of time, led to an investigation of whether already and yet were really adverbs of time, as is usually assumed. The conclusions we reached are that already and yet indeed form a suppletion set (with certain limitations not shared by other suppletives), but that they cannot usefully be treated as time adverbs. Rather, they seem to have close connexions with perfect aspect. The arguments presented here in support of this hypothesis are by no means exhaustive but will hopefully provide a suggestive contribution toward the study of both adverbs and aspects.},

It argues that the observations can be derived from a standard interpretation of certain/certainly as universal and possible/possibly as existential quantifiers over possible worlds, in conjunction with the hypothesis that the adjectives quantify over knowledge and the adverbs quantify over belief. The claims on which the argument relies include the following: (i) knowledge implies belief, (ii) agents have epistemic access to their belief, (iii) relevance is closed under speakers’ belief, and (iv) commitment is pragmatically inconsistent with explicit denial of belief.},

Causal wh and reason wh are analyzed as sentential operators in the left periphery, which scope over the entire IP and take the corresponding event/state as their complements. By contrast, manner and instrumental wh’s are both analyzed as vP-modifiers, which translate into restrictive predicates of the underlying event argument associated with the peripheral area of vP. These wh-expressions differ dramatically with respect to their behavior towards locality principles. On the one hand, only instrumental wh, but not manner wh, may escape from strong island effects and weak intervention effects. On the other, they both observe strong intervention effects, triggered by negation and A-not-A questions. It is suggested that this apparent paradox can be solved by a generalized version of Relativized Minimality proposed in Rizzi (Structures and beyond. The cartography of syntactic structures. Oxford University Press, New York, 2004).},

  abstract = {There are two generalizations that can be drawn from our studies of Chinese wide scope quantification over universal and polarity expressions: Firstly, Scope Isomorphism can be correlated with the robust analyticity of Chinese in both formal and typological terms: The design of a composite quantifier is essentially the product of unselective binding among discrete quantificational “parts” such as operators-in-situ (e.g., Q, dou, existential closure, etc.) and variables-in-situ (e.g. indefinite wh’s, indefinite NPs, polarity items, etc.). Secondly, unselective binding with the scope marker dou and a variety of implicit operators is subject to strong intervention effects, but not strong island effects. The former is an instance of feature-based relativized minimality, while the latter is defined by dominating barriers in relation to subjacency (or the notion of phases in minimalist terms). Hopefully, this study will present a clearer picture of the core typological features of Chinese quantificational constructions, which have been under constant scrutiny since Huang's (1982) seminal work on the LF construals of wh’s-in-situ. It seems that Chinese implements the pairing of operators and variable in a true minimalist way, namely, merging them where they should be without resorting to syntactic movement or pied-piping. If our line of thinking is on the right track, then it may well be the case that the scope isomorphism and the wide scope universal/polarity construals are two facets of one phenomenon: That is, an operator-variable pair is constructed on a sentential scale thanks to the positive setting of the analyticity parameter in Huang’s (2015) sense.},

This move begs the question “syntax preempts semantics and pragmatic, but how?”. One way to think of the issue is to build a loosely organized syntactic hierarchy based upon the “height of interpretation”, a term borrowed from Hacquard (2006). As Ramchand \& Svenonius (2014) shows, the traditional C-T-V split of a sentence structure may well reflect the ontological arrangement of proposition-situation-event (see also Platzack 2000; Wiltschko 2014). On the other hand, the cause-process-result hierarchy encoded by the first phase syntax in Ramchand’s (2008) sense is often extended beyond the vP periphery, manifesting itself up to the CP domain in Chinese, presumably due to its robust analyticity (cf. Huang 2015, Tsai 2015). In this paper, we propose to combine the insights from both projects, and see how the notion of causality can be projected along the clausal spine. Altogether there are three types of implicit causative projection that will be placed under our investigation. They all involve eventuality construals (in contrast to agentivity/activity) in the peripheral areas.},

The results of our best performing models mostly align with those of humans, both in the large differences we find between those inferences and implicatures, as well as in fine-grained distinctions among different aspects of those inferences.},

Unlike previous accounts, where emphasis is put mainly on highlighting the similarity of minimizers to any-PIs and on supporting the contribution of an even-reading, I integrate the peculiar behaviour of minimizers in English within an analysis of negative indefinites as existential quantifiers that can structurally associate with negation in different ways. I claim that English minimizers contain three basic ingredients: a Numeral Phrase, a Focus particle and, in negative contexts, a Negative Phrase, not. The presence of a Focus particle even in the structure of minimizers plus the flexible merging possibilities of not with respect to the other two components of the minimizer result in their NQ-like behaviour, which can be now fully integrated into a theory of negative indefinites as syntactic objects that are compositionally built.},

Using some of these diagnostics, in addition to the availability of partial control interpretations, Grano (2012/2015) argues that the distinction between types of clauses in Mandarin is not based on finiteness, but rather based on whether there is restructuring: some complement clauses are vPs, while others are CPs. We provide new data based on the distribution and interpretation of the reflexive ziji, which suggests that there is a finite/nonfinite distinction. We argue for the existence of nonfinite control complements in Mandarin. Further, we evaluate the diagnostics used by previous researchers and illustrate that some of them are not reliable indicators of finiteness or of clause size.},

First, the meaning of if is formalized through a semantics that builds on the proposal given by Stalnaker [1968]. A major difference from Stalnaker’s approach is that irrelevant conditionals (i.e., conditionals where the antecedent and the consequent have no connection) are false in this new setting. Second, the meaning of even is analyzed through a formal semantics based on the notion of scale. This analysis overcomes the problems arising in standard approaches, in which even is analyzed with the help of pragmatic presuppositions. Finally, the two particles are combined in order to provide a formal analysis of even if. This theory predicts the major phenomena concerning the behavior of concessive conditionals and without any call to pragmatic explanations. More generally, this approach creates the possibility of a compositional analysis of other conditionals such as if then or only if forms.},

  abstract = {In Spanish (and other Romance languages) certain predicates select the subjunctive mood in the embedded clause, while others select the indicative mood. In this paper, I present a new analysis for the predicates that select the subjunctive mood in Spanish that is based on a semantics of comparison. The main generalization proposed here is the following: in Spanish, a predicate selects the subjunctive mood in its embedded proposition if the proposition is compared to its contextual alternatives on a scale introduced by the predicate. In this proposal, predicates that select the subjunctive mood are thus analyzed as gradable predicates. Furthermore, the subjunctive mood morpheme is claimed to make a semantic contribution, namely to evaluate the contextual alternatives that are compared by the predicate. In comparing this proposal to other approaches, I show that it can more straightforwardly account for a number of properties of these predicates (entailment relations, practical inferences, and contexts with more than two alternatives). New empirical evidence for two crucial properties of the predicates that select the subjunctive mood is provided: these predicates are focus sensitive and they are gradable, two properties that follow directly from the proposal developed here. In the vast literature on mood, the link between the appearance of the subjunctive mood and these important properties has never been made before.},

Evidence is presented to show that only here is modifying an underlying proposition (its ‘prejacent’). After discussing the semantics of only, the question of the proper interpretation of the prejacent is explored. It would be nice if the prejacent could be analyzed as having existential quantificational force. But that is difficult to maintain, since the prejacent structures when encountered on their own are naturally read as having a lawlike flavor, which in many analyses is attributed to the semantics of implicit operators alleged to be present in them. In the end, an analysis is presented which attributes some very particular properties to these operators and thereby succeeds in providing the target sentences with intuitively adequate interpretations. These complex constructions can therefore be used as a probe into the nature of implicit quantification in natural language.},

On the hypothesis that there should be a compositional form-to-meaning mapping, we explore the semantics of weak necessity modals and propose how to derive this semantics from the combination of a strong necessity modal and counterfactual marking. Specifically, building on the semantics for weak necessity modals proposed by Sloman, we propose that weak necessity modals are the result of the promotion of a secondary ordering source of a strong necessity modal. This meta-linguistic operation is signaled or effected by counterfactual marking. The fact that it is a strong necessity modal that is counterfactually marked crosslinguistically, shows that even with weak necessity modals the quantificational force is universal.},

Epistemic modals quantify over possibilities compatible with what is known. Just whose knowledge, or whose information state, is relevant is something decided by the context. The canon is simple and elegant but not quite right. The problem with the canon is that it is weighed down by the fiction that there is a determinate context in which an utterance of a bare epistemic modal is issued. On the story of this chapter, it is indeterminate just which group, or just which aggregated information state, is quantified over by such bare epistemic modals. This chapter explores how a story that exploits this contextual indeterminacy can explain what needs explaining without departing from what's right about the canon and so without positing anything semantically peculiar about bare occurrences of epistemic modals.},

Contrary to classic discussions of the phenomenon such as by Karttunen, Kratzer, and Veltman, we argue that instead of having a weak semantics, must presupposes the presence of an indirect inference or deduction rather than of a direct observation. This is independent of the strength of the claim being made. Epistemic must is therefore quite similar to evidential markers of indirect evidence known from languages with rich evidential systems. We work towards a formalization of the evidential component, relying on a structured model of information states (analogous to some models used in the belief dynamics literature). We explain why in many contexts, one can perceive a lack of confidence on the part of the speaker who uses must.},

In this paper, I consider some of the moves that are needed to maintain its basic intuition in some recalcitrant arenas: negative polarity licensing by only , adversatives, superlatives, and conditionals. We will see that one has to (i) use a notion of entailment that I call Strawson Entailment , which deals with presuppositions in a particular way, and (ii) prohibit (even natural) context change during an inference. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to justify these constraints and to see in detail how the semantics of the problematic constructions has to work in order for these moves to successfully rescue the Fauconnier-Ladusaw analysis.  I will first show the two assumptions at work in the analysis of NPI licensing by only and adversatives (building on proposals by Kadmon \&amp; Landman). I then turn to NPI licensing in the antecedent of conditionals. The standard Stalnaker-Lewis semantics for conditionals— if p, q is true iff q is true in the closest p -world(s)—might make one suspect that once one has an explanation for NPI licensing by superlatives, that would immediately deliver an explanation for NPI licensing in conditionals. But it turns out that the particular analysis that seems appropriate for NPI licensing by superlatives cannot plausibly carry over to conditionals. Instead, one does better by appealing to an alternative analysis of conditionals, one that I have elsewhere argued for on independent grounds.},

  abstract = {This dissertation investigates the ways in which natural language restricts the domains of quantifiers. Adverbs of quantification are analyzed as quantifying over situations (instead of being unselective quantifiers). The domain of quantifiers is pragmatically constrained: apparent processes of "semantic partition" are treated as pragmatic epiphenomena. The introductory Chapter 1 sketches some of the background of work on natural language quantification and begins the analysis of adverbial quantification over situations. Chapter 2 develops the central picture of "semantic partition" as a side-effect of pragmatic processes of anaphora resolution. I argue that the apparent effects of topic/focus articulation and presuppositional information on the interpretation of quantifiers are not the result of a direct and local mechanism of sentence grammar. Instead, I develop an analysis where the link is established via the anaphoric dependence of quantifier domains on the discourse context. Chapter 3 discusses the analysis of conditional clauses as quantifier restrictors, concentrating on the question whether conditional clauses restrict quantifiers directly (like common noun phrases restrict determiner-quantifiers) or indirectly (like topic/focus restrict quantifiers). A treatment is explored which has if-clauses constrain the value of the hidden domain variable of the restricted quantifier. Chapter 4, on unless-clauses, and Chapter 5, on only if- and even if-clauses, present some issues in the compositional analysis of complex conditional clauses. These chapters significantly expand the data coverage of the theory of A-quantification. Building on previous work of mine on exceptives, I analyze unless-clauses as exceptive operators on A-quantifiers. The analysis of only if-clauses, treated as conditional clauses that combine if with the focus adverb only, unearthes some interesting new properties. Chapter 6, finally, examines the phenomenon of donkey-anaphora in the light of the results of the previous chapters. I show that a solution to the proportion problem may become possible once we combine the situation-semantic approach to adverbial quantification with the pragmatic theory developed in Chapter 2 and further elaborated in the analysis of donkey anaphora in complex conditionals.},

We argued that all three sub-mantras are wrong and offered an explanation according to which must is strong, entailing, and the felt indirectness is the product of an evidential presupposition carried by epistemic modals. Mantras being what they are, it is no surprise that each of the sub-mantras have been given new defenses. Here we offer them new problems and update our picture, concluding that must is (still) strong.},

We examine potential semantic universals in three areas: (i) the lexicon, (ii) semantic “glue” (functional morphemes and composition principles), and (iii) pragmatics. At the level of the lexicon, we find remarkably few convincing semantic universals. At the level of functional morphemes and composition principles, we discuss a number of promising constraints, most of which require further empirical testing and/or refinement. In the realm of pragmatics, we predict that Gricean mechanisms are universal, but suggest that the precise nature of presuppositions may be subject to cross-linguistic variation. Finally, we follow E.L. Keenan in concluding that the overarching universal of effability or translatability between languages cannot be upheld in its strongest form. A recurring theme throughout this survey is how much work still remains to be done in the relatively young field of cross-linguistic formal semantics.},

I show that we need a theory of lexical distributivity to account for distributive interpretations with group nouns like 'team' and 'committee', as operator-based distributivity is systematically unavailable with these nouns. An apparent counterexample to this claim are sentences like "The team is wearing an orange vest", whose distributive interpretation seems to require a covert quantifier over team members to take scope over the indefinite. However, I argue that this is not a case of quantificational distributivity, but of two-place lexical distributivity over two arguments: a group and (an individual correlate of) a property.},

It is envisioned to inspire radical rethinking of the ontology of models accounting for nominal semantics. Specifically, it provides novel evidence for a mereotopological approach to meaning, i.e., a theory of wholes that captures not only parthood but also topological relations holding between parts. This evidence comes from the phenomenon of subatomic quantification, i.e., quantification over parts of referents of concrete count nouns.},

This paper looks at the distributional pattern of NPIs under ‘only’ and presents evidence for the movement theory of focus association and against an in situ approach. NPIs are licensed in the ‘scope’ (or the second argument) of ‘only’, but not in the complement (or its first argument), which I will call the ‘syntactic restrictor’. While earlier approaches argued that ‘only’ licenses NPIs in the unfocused part of the sentence it occurs in except in its focus, evidence from DP-‘only’ shows that NPIs are also not licensed in the unfocused part of the syntactic restrictor. The distribution of NPIs provides a test for the size of the syntactic restrictor, and this test is applied to the case of VP-‘only’. The evidence shows that (i) the restrictor can be smaller than the entire VP and is not necessarily identical to the surface complement of ‘only’; (ii) in the case of association with a head the restrictor comprises an XP containing the head; and (iii) in cases of association into an island, the restrictor comprises the entire island. Generalizations (i)–(iii) can be captured straightforwardly by a movement approach but are incompatible with an in situ analysis. Contextual domain- restriction of the kind used in in situ approaches accounts for the appropriate semantics in cases where the semantic focus is properly contained in the syntactic restrictor of ‘only’.},

A non-compositional rule of interpretation that refers to these features is used to derive a topic semantic value, a nested set of sets of propositions. This paper presents evidence for a correlation between the restrictive syntax of nested focus operators and the syntax of contrastive topics, a correlation which is unexpected under this analysis. A compositional analysis is proposed that only makes use of the flatter focus semantic values introduced by focus operators. The analysis aims at integrating insights from the original analysis while at the same time capturing the observed syntactic restrictions. http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp.5.8 BibTeX info},

A production experiment provides evidence for the need of syntactic alternative projection. The analysis builds on Potts's (2007) analysis of mixed quotation, which formalizes a grammar that can operate over expressions of the grammar. The proposal here is that certain operators, such as the focus operator ∼, operate over sets of linguistic expressions and their meanings. Syntactic projection may also explain puzzling facts in other domains, such as echo questions and disjunction.},

The previous pragmatic approach by Ye (2020) establishes a link between focus in polar questions and question bias to explain this biased reading. However, the current study finds that two other A-not-A questions formed by epistemic modals, hui-not-hui and keneng-not-keneng which are not focus markers, obligatorily produce positively biased readings as well. I propose that biased A-not-A questions are a type of high-negation questions with A-not-A residing outside of TP. shi, hui and keneng should all be analyzed as epistemic modals which are the overt realization of Goodhue’s (2019) epistemic operator scoped by the negator. The positively biased reading is derived from the resulting unbalanced partition based on general pragmatic principles. This analysis from the semantic aspect provides new evidence for the argument that the first A has reality only in PF. Furthermore, the Mandarin Chinese data lends evidence to Goodhue’s (2019) argument that there exists a doxastic speech operator between NegP and TP in high negation questions. The paper also provides explanations for previously remaining questions on bias cancelation by the stress marker daodi and factive predicates like zhidao (“know”).},

Eye movements were monitored during reading, and there was a secondary task of detecting the word change. Results indicated that when a word changed, participants were more successful at detecting it when it was in focus. In the second display, there were more fixations and longer viewing times on a changed than on an unchanged word, but only when the critical word was in focus; eye movement data for changed and unchanged words did not differ when the word was not in focus.

  abstract = {The distribution of the Hungarian negative particle nem can be accounted for without the use of any specialised syntactic machinery, given a dynamic, parsing-based approach to the creation of meaningful linguistic structures. This allows inferential pragmatic theory (such as Relevance Theory) to take on much of the burden of explanation. Well-known interactions between nem and a variety of pre-verbal phenomena, notably focused constituents, are explained with reference to ‘main predication’: the point in a sentence at which a full proposition is created. This is represented, using a neo-Davidsonian semantics, as the introduction of existential quantification over an event description with certain necessary properties. Marrying event-based representations with the epsilon calculus of Hilbert and Bernays (1939) allows this to be achieved using a variety of predicates introduced by explicit lexical material.},

  abstract = {Theories of plural predication disagree on the division of labor between the lexical semantics of predicates and various syntactic operators, e.g. the distributivity operator (Krifka 1992; Kratzer 2007). A central issue is whether the LFs giving rise to certain distributive and cumulative readings involve syntactic movement (Beck and Sauerland 2000; Winter 2000). In this project, we adopt the logic of Hackl, Koster-Hale, and Varvoutis (2012) to diagnose movement indirectly via a facilitation effect on ACD resolution. We show that, similar to every, definite plurals under a particular distributive construal decrease the cost of ACD resolution compared to a definite singular baseline. This provides evidence that the distributive reading requires LF-movement of the plural DP hosting ACD above the matrix antecedent of the ellided constituent. We argue that this follows naturally only from theories of distributivity/cumulativity on which there is a syntactically represented distributivity operator that the plural DP needs to outscope in order to get the desired reading.},

The modality \$\$\textbackslash textsf\{E\}\$\$expresses scientists’ have (conclusive) experimental evidence indicating a dependence relation between the causal factor \$\$\textbackslash psi \$\$and \$\$\textbackslash varphi \$\$. Based on the evidence, scientists often package some (perhaps seemingly unrelated) phenomena together, and the modality \$\$\textbackslash textsf\{W\}\$\$captures scientists’ knowing why in their entirety, or having systematic knowledge-why of them, which amounts to having a unified scientific theory of all these dependences. A sound and complete axiomatization is given, followed by a decidability result. Many notions of much philosophical interest are embodied in the present framework. We also draw several comparisons and connections with some existing relevant logical work.},

However, while exceptional in English, collectives are the rule in so-called ‘classifier languages’ (e.g., Mandarin) and also in some Indo-European languages (e.g., Persian), pointing to a general, systematic option for nouns, rather than an idiosyncratic phenomenon. The chapter discusses collectives from a cross-linguistic point of view, and show that they are located at an intersection of mass and count nouns that indicates an autonomy of syntactic and conceptual features, rather than the one-to-one correlation suggested by such noun pairs as cows (reference to subjects, marked for number) vs. beef (reference to substance, no number marking). This autonomy supports a cross-linguistic mass/count distinction that is independent of the availability of syntactic plural marking in a language.},

The goal of this paper is to develop and defend a broadly expressivist explanation of this phenomenon: acquaintance inferences arise because plain sentences containing subjective predicates are designed to express distinguished kinds of attitudes that differ from beliefs in that they can only be acquired by undergoing certain experiences. Its guiding hypothesis is that natural language predicate expressions lexically specify what it takes for their use to be properly ‘grounded’ in a speaker's state of mind: what state of mind a speaker must be in for a predication to be in accordance with the norms governing assertion. The resulting framework accounts for a range of data surrounding the acquaintance inference as well as for striking parallels between the evidential requirements on subjective predicate uses and the kind of considerations that fuel motivational internalism about the language of morals. A discussion of how the story can be implemented compositionally and of how it compares with other proposals currently on the market is provided.},

The fact, or so I shall argue here, disrupts the folklore: given minimal assumptions about the semantics and pragmatics of indicative conditionals, a textbook variably strict analysis fails to predict that indicative Sobel sequences are felicitous. The correct lesson to draw from Sobel sequences is that their felicity challenges classical implementations of the variably strict and of the plainly strict analysis alike. In response to this challenge I develop a dynamic strict analysis of conditionals that handles indicative Sobel sequences with grace while preserving intuitive constraints on the semantics and pragmatics of their members. A discussion of how such an analysis may handle the challenge from reverse Sobel sequences is provided. BibTeX info},

It shows that the data are well explained by a dynamic semantic analysis of modals and conditionals that uses ideas from the inquisitive semantic tradition in its treatment of disjunction. The analysis explains why embedding a disjunctive possibility under negation reverts disjunction to its classical behavior, is general enough to predict less studied simplification patterns, and also makes progress toward a unified perspective on the distinction between informative, inquisitive, and attentive content.},

This category can host the feature responsible for the mass/count distinction (i.e, [± bounded]). It is further shown that languages lacking a categorical mass/count distinction come in at least two varieties. They can lack the functional category which may host the [±bounded] feature (Halkomelem). Alternatively, they can associated a different feature with inner aspect. In particular, it is shown that in Blackfoot [±animate] associates with inner aspect. Consequently, in this language, it is animacy, rather than mass/count which serves as the nominal classification device.},

This paper’s main goal is to spell out vF\&amp;I’s idea that X-marking on want reflects a widening of want’s quantificational domain, thereby doing the same job as it does in conditionals under an influential view originating with Stalnaker (1975). With Sode (2021), but also Grano \&amp; Phillips-Brown (2022), the proposition \$\textbackslash phi \$ denoted by want’s complement is treated as the antecedent of a “hidden conditional” that Heim (1992) sees in want and desire-ascriptions more generally, a treatment in whose favor vF\&amp;I’s Conditional/Desire Pattern provides morphosyntactic evidence. In line with the Stalnakerian view, but also more recent ones under which X-marking is semantically vacuous (Crowley 2022; Leahy 2011, 2018), X-marking on want is treated as reflecting the absence of a presuppositional constraint that the O-marked counterpart comes with: a limitation of closest antecedent-worlds to the attitude holder’s belief set.},

  abstract = {Common versions of event semantics do not naturally explain the obligatory narrow scope of existential quantification over events, or the typically event-oriented modification by adverbials. We argue that these linguistic properties reflect a distinction between overt arguments and purely semantic slots like the event argument. The distinction is naturally captured in Abstract Categorial Grammar (ACG) [1,2,3,4], which manipulates pairs of forms and meanings, a.k.a. linguistic signs. The sign’s pheno-type defines syntactic arguments and the sign’s semantic type standardly defines semantic arguments. Both these concrete types are standardly derived by induction on the structure of one abstract type (category) of the sign, by assigning pheno-level and semantic types to basic abstract types. We assume that semantic event arguments are only introduced by the (basic) result type of the verb’s abstract type, whose pheno-level type is standardly a string. Consequently semantic event arguments lack a correlate in the verb’s pheno-type. Both narrow-scope existential quantification over events and the orientation of event modifiers follow rigorously from this assumption. Based on this architecture, we develop simple accounts of adverbial modification, nominalization and passive constructions in an ACG fragment.},

This is generally satisfied by an overt but-phrase, except with the not-many-sentence because it entails an alternative sentence on its own–'Some students arrived'. I also take the contrast between 'not many' and negated numerals as evidence that they have different types of assertion, in support of Kennedy (2013, 2015): 'many' asserts at least n, while numerals assert at least n and at most n at the same time. Therefore, in contrast to 'not many', which entails 'some', 'not three' does not entail 'not one' or 'not two', and thus requires the but-phrase to introduce the true alternative.},

  abstract = {Mandarin Chinese is claimed to be a scope-rigid language, as its doubly-quantified simple transitive sentences are unambiguous with surface scope only and no inverse scope available. However, it has been debated whether Mandarin Chinese allows inverse scope in some syntactic environments other than simple transitives. This paper investigates whether scope rigidity as a property of the grammar of Mandarin prevents scope ambiguity in different syntactic environments and what factors influence scope interpretations. Using a Truth-Value Judgment task, we tested the judgments of 98 Mandarin Chinese native speakers on transitive sentences containing both a subject and object quantifier under adverbial clauses. The results show that inverse scope reading is considered available for doubly-quantified transitives under adverbial clauses, although there are intra-participant variances. The results challenge the well-established approaches to quantifier scope in Mandarin and call for rethinking the long-standing dichotomy view of quantifier scope in languages. We also found bimodal distribution on the acceptance of inverse scope readings, suggesting that there may be two different populations of native speakers with two different grammars. In addition, we also observed other factors that may affect scope behaviors, including clause type, presence of aspect marker, verb type, and numbers.},

I argue for a question-based analysis in line with Jasinskaja and Zeevat (2008, 2009) and Toosarvandani (2014) but also with key differences from them: "whereas" requires there to be a question under discussion (QUD) whose subquestions are good questions that are then answered by the clauses combined by "whereas". This analysis is motivated by novel data that point to a strong correlation between the felicity of "whereas"-sentences and the felicity of its conjuncts as direct answers to the QUD. The finding of a dedicated lexical item "whereas" for semantic opposition suggests that semantic opposition is a distinct use of "but", supporting Toosarvandani (2014). "Whereas"- and "but"-coordination shows the linguistic and cognitive reality of the notions of good-questionhood and informativeness, which the felicity of these coordinated structures depends on. This paper also provides a new diagnostic of question-answerhood that relies not on question-answer pairs, but on "whereas"- and "but"-sentences, declarative sentences that are nevertheless closely related to question-answering.},

I argue that there are two positions for negation. Either position may be pronounced, but only the higher position is interpreted. In addition, ellipsis deletes repeated material in the second conjunct, leading to the appearance that negation is higher than it actually is. This analysis is consonant with previous proposals for the syntax of focus-sensitive operators such as the Question-particle and 'only', suggesting that all focus-sensitive operators, as is exemplified by negation here, may have two positions in a sentence. My syntactic analysis draws evidence from a mix of domains, including syntax, semantics and a prosodic experiment, following a tradition in the literature that looks to prosody for evidence for the syntactic structure (e.g. Bresnan 1971; Clemens and Coon 2018; Clemens 2021). This prosodic experiment further demonstrates the mutual reinforcement of syntactic theory and prosodic experimentation: not only can we draw evidence for syntactic theories from prosody, but syntactic theories also lay the foundation for investigations of syntax-prosody mapping.},

Varying by the item it is associated with and the prosodic pattern of the environment it appears in, dou can trigger a distributivity effect, license a pre-verbal free choice item, or evoke an even-like inference. Considering universal grammar a simple system, we need to figure out, for a multi-functional particle, which of its functions is primary, what parametric variations are responsible for the alternations in function, and how these variations are conditioned. In this paper, I argue that the seemingly unrelated functions of dou share the same source: dou is a pre-exhaustification exhaustifier operating on sub-alternatives. Uniformly, dou affirms the truth of its propositional prejacent, negates the exhaustification of each sub-alternative, and presupposes a non-vacuity inference that there is at least one sub-alternative. Alternations in function result from minimal weakening operations on the semantics of sub-alternatives. In particular, sub-alternatives are primarily weaker alternatives, and the non-vacuity presupposition of dou yields a distributivity effect. When the semantics of sub-alternatives is weakened under particular syntactic or prosodic conditions, dou gains its other logical functions.},

However, evidence from questions with necessity modals and questions with collective predicates argues that sometimes a wh-question must be interpreted with a higher-order reading, in which this question calls for an answer that names a generalized quantifier. This paper investigates the distribution and compositional derivation of higher-order readings of wh-questions. First, I argue that the generalized quantifiers that can serve as semantic answers to wh-questions must be homogeneously positive. Next, on the distribution of higher-order readings, I observe that questions in which the wh-complement is singular-marked or numeral-modified can be answered by elided disjunctions but not by conjunctions. I further present two ways to account for this disjunction–conjunction asymmetry. In the uniform account, these questions admit disjunctions because disjunctions (but not conjunctions) may satisfy the atomicity requirement of singular-marking and the cardinality requirement of numeral modification. In the reconstruction account, the wh-complement is syntactically reconstructed, which gives rise to local uniqueness and yields a contradiction for conjunctive answers.},

  abstract = {Questions with a quantificational subject have readings that seemingly involve quantification into questions (called ‘QiQ’ for short). In particular, in single-wh questions with a universal quantifier, QiQ-readings call for pair-list answers, similar to pair-list readings of multiple-wh questions. This paper unifies the derivation of QiQ-readings and distinguishes QiQ-readings from pair-list readings of multiple-wh questions. I propose that pair-list multiple-wh questions and QiQ-questions both involve a wh-dependency, namely, that the wh-/quantificational subject stands in a functional dependency with the trace of the wh-object. In particular, in a pair-list multiple-wh question, the wh-subject binds into the trace of the wh-object across an identity operator; in a QiQ-question, the quantificational subject binds into the trace of the wh-object across a predication operator. These operations give rise to distinct definedness requirements, which vary with the quantificational force of the wh-/quantificational subject. The proposed analysis explains a contrast in domain exhaustivity between the pair-list readings of multiple-wh questions and questions with a universal quantifier, while also doing justice to the intuitive similarities between these two types of questions. I further propose that the observed QiQ-effect in a QiQ-question is derived by extracting one of the minimal proposition sets that satisfy the aforementioned quantificational predication condition. The values of these sets determine whether the QiQ-reading is available and whether a QiQ-question admits pair-list answers and/or has a choice flavor.},

I assume that MS and MA answers can be modeled using the same definition of answerhood (Fox in Mention-some interpretations, MIT seminar, 2013) and attribute the MS/MA ambiguity to structural variations within the question nucleus. The variations are: (i) the scope ambiguity of the higher-order wh-trace and (ii) the absence/presence of an anti-exhaustification operator. However, treating MS answers as complete answers in this way contradicts the widely adopted analysis of uniqueness effects in questions of Dayal (Locality in wh quantification: Questions and relative clauses in Hindi, 1996), according to which the uniqueness effects of singular which-phrases arise from an exhaustivity presupposition, namely that a question must have a unique exhaustive true answer. To solve this dilemma, I propose that question interpretations presuppose Relativized Exhaustivity: roughly, the exhaustivity in questions is evaluated relative to the accessible worlds as opposed to the anchor/utterance world. Relativized Exhaustivity preserves the merits of Dayal’s exhaustivity presupposition while permitting MS; moreover, it explains the local-uniqueness effects in modalized singular wh-questions.},

First and foremost, epistemic yào is restricted to occur in explicit strict comparative constructions and is disallowed in other degree constructions or non-degree constructions. No modals have been documented in prior literature of Chinese linguistics or  general linguistics to manifest such a restrictive distribution. Second, epistemic yào manifests flexibility with respect to where it can appear in certain explicit strict comparative constructions, and it allows multiple occurrences in certain contexts. Third, epistemic yào carries a quantificational force stronger than that of existential modals, yet weaker than that of strong necessity modals. I propose that epistemic yào is an adjunct modifier for strict comparative morphemes, thus setting it apart from epistemic modals that take propositions as their arguments. The weak necessity quantificational force of epistemic yào is encoded in its semantics by making recourse to alternative modal bases, which represents an innovative approach to capturing weak necessity. Through investigating epistemic yào, I hope to bring to the forefront some hitherto unnoticed interesting properties in natural language modality and reveal new intra- and inter-linguistic variations in the distribution and interpretation of modal elements.},

  abstract = {Bias is a linguistic phenomenon that is primarily found in questions. Various kinds of biased questions have been studied extensively in the literature, e.g. Negative Polar Questions, Questions with Minimizers, Questions with Verum focus (Ladd 1981, Buring \& Gunlogson 2000, Guerzoni 2003, Romero \& Han 2004, a.o.). Aside from those biased questions, there are questions with dedicated words that can express bias (i.e. biased question words). Those words are "nandao" in Mandarin, "etwa" in German, and "naki" in Bangla. The current dissertation takes a modal approach to bias, distinct from earlier accounts of bias. In order to find out the nature of bias, e.g. how it is introduced, at which level it is interpreted, and why it is primarily found in questions, I study the three biased question words at the interface of syntax, semantics and pragmatics. Based on the analyses of the three words, I claim that bias is a not-at-issue content that is revealed via the speaker's public belief domain (i.e. Discourse commitment). Considering the phenomenon in general, I isolate three conditions for introducing bias: a preference ranking of alternatives, selection of a particular alternative as privileged, and the requirement to update the Question Under Discussion with the alternatives. Biased question words lexically satisfy all three conditions and give rise to the obligatorily biased reading of questions containing them. With these three conditions, I provide a definition for bias and explain the opening statement that "bias is a linguistic phenomenon that is primarily found in questions".},

  abstract = {This chapter explores the prospects for a unified theory of deontic and (so-called) epistemic modality. A theory of deontic modality needs to solve the puzzles raised by David Lewis in ‘A Puzzle About Permission’. In particular, it needs to say what the effect is of making something permissible, and what consequences a permission has in terms of what else is thereby permitted. It is argued that when p is made permissible, then a world w is still impermissible if, antecedently, w was impermissible for a reason not implying p. This model is extended to (so-called) epistemic modality. What should happen to the conversational context when it is accepted that it might be that p? The chapter suggests that three things happen. Most obviously, the common ground of the conversation now includes at least one world where p. Further, the common ground now includes worlds that were previously only ruled out for reasons that entailed \textasciitilde p. Finally, once it is accepted that it might be that p, this cancels any assertion that \textasciitilde p, even one that has not been explicitly made in this conversation.},

I argue that there is a correlation between the possibility of using yĕ and the presence of a scalar reading as well as a reference to an extremity on the scale in question. The data we present show that yě is invariably associated with scalar readings: yě is always used in scalar contexts, and contexts that are not obviously scalar become so when yě is used. I also argue that a scalar interpretation of wh-elements in no matter contexts can be derived with the aid of negation or modals, thus accounting for the felicitousness of yě in such contexts. The paper ends with a short note on lián, hypothesizing that its function is to introduce the extreme of the scale. I also argue that the licensing condition of the additive/basic yě, i.e., the presence of alternatives in the background, also plays a role in the scalar use of yě.},

  abstract = {Previous online processing studies on Mandarin~concerning~tone and intonation mainly focus on yes-no questions and declaratives. Little is known how~intonations and tones work when processing wh-questions. Mandarin Chinese provides an interesting test case, as sentences containing wh-words can contrast in interrogatives (wh-questions) and string-identical declaratives, due to the fact that Mandarin wh-words like shénme~can appear in wh-questions, where they seem similar to English “what” and in declaratives, where they are translated~as “something” in English. Shénme~has a citation tone of mid-rising (shén) and neutral (me) respectively, but it is realized differently in wh-questions (shénme~bearing an expanded rising tonal contour) and declaratives (a compressed tonal contour which is low and flat). To uncover how exactly wh-questions and string-identical declaratives are processed and how the intonation induced tonal contour of shénme further impacts online processing, we conducted an auditory ERP study on 24 native speakers of Mandarin on wh-sentences by manipulating the congruency of audios of wh-questions and declaratives. We cross-spliced the audios starting from the critical word shénme, yielding altogether four conditions: declaratives (henceforth D-D, baseline), a cross-spliced incongruent condition (D-Q), wh-questions (Q-Q, baseline), and a cross-spliced incongruent condition (Q-D), all preceded by contexts prompting clause types of the pre-wh-word region. Repeated-measure ANOVA results manifest Anterior Negativities in the time window of 200-500ms after the onset of~shénme~only when processing the incongruent condition D-Q as compared with D-D, indicating a detection of the unexpected prosody at shénme. The neural correlates and their time courses during auditory processing as well as the asymmetry between the processing of D-Q and Q-D are~further discussed.},

Their interpretations in a sentence are usually not ambiguous, as the distinct interpretations need to be licensed by particular items/contexts. The starting point of our study concerns a case which allows the wh-words to remain ambiguous in a sentence: wh-words such as shénme appearing with diǎnr. After empirically confirming that such sentences are indeed ambiguous (Study 1), we turn to the question of whether and how prosody helps disambiguate such sentences. Our production experiment (Study 2) shows that wh-declaratives differ from wh-questions in terms of prosodic properties already from the clause onset. Wh-declaratives are longer than wh-questions starting from the subject and the pattern reverses at the wh-word; wh-declaratives are lower in F0 and smaller in F0 range than wh-questions at the wh-word and there is a F0 range compression in the post-wh-word region in wh-questions; wh-declaratives show larger intensity range than wh-questions at the verb and the pattern reverses at the wh-word. An implication of this study concerns the focal status of wh-words in wh-questions and wh-declaratives: wh-words are foci in wh-questions but cannot be foci in wh-declaratives.},

Copula clefts typically have the form [NP SHI XP DE] and cue both specificational and contrastive meaning. The study is a contribution to the developing field of constructionalization by making more explicit the way in which individual constructional changes contribute sequentially to constructionalization.

  abstract = {This paper, based on a cross-linguistic understanding of the concepts of "copula" and "cleft", demonstrates that the Standard Modern Chinese shì is an invariant non-inflectional verb typically co-occurring with NPs whereby they together form the predicate of a copular sentence. According to Construction Grammar (theorized by Goldberg 1995, 2006, Croft2001, 2005, etc.), a copular construction can be understood as a form and meaning pair that entails a proposition with the nominal semantics of specificational and predicational (Blom \& Daalder 1977, Declerck 1988, Patten 2010, Zhan 2012). Furthermore, a constructional schematic taxonomy is proposed for the prototypical Chinese copular construction, under which the cleft construction is a subschema of the specificational copular construction. The Chinese cleft[NP COP NOM] denotes the specificational meaning (the NP and the nominalization representing a referential member and a non-referential but restricted set forming a member-class relationship) plus a contrastive focus. Finally, the cleft construction is treated to have two subschemas: cleft-sbj and cleft-obj. In a cleft-sbj sentence, the sentential subject is co-referential with the subject in the embedded nominalization, and the presence of the nominalizer de is optional. In a cleft-obj sentence, the sentential subject is co-referential with the object in the nominalization, and the presence of the nominalizer is obligatory. It will be shown that the treatment of shì as an adverb in the cleft-sbj sentence (Teng 1979, Huang 1998, etc.) falls short in explaining why shì can co-occur with an optional de. With a copula treatment of shì, the presence of de as a nominalizer logically follows from a specificational [NP COP NOM] analysis. Therefore, the Chinese cleft construction basically functions to signal, instead of a transitory process that an adverbial hypothesis implies, a non-transitory state or situation.

We propose that with a built-in Gricean Maxim of Quantity Be Informative in its lexical semantics, a NOCH-type particle explicitly requires that the discourse be incremental, and the NOCH-marked sentence add new information and further narrow down the context set, making the whole discourse even more informative. We also show that the cross-linguistic widespread distribution of NOCH-type particles is not arbitrary: there are three ways to build an incremental discourse structure, and these three implementations give rise to the three major uses of NOCH-type particles.},

  abstract = {In this paper, by zooming into the components of comparison (i.e., the target, the standard, and their difference), we have demonstrated a new perspective on cross-linguistic universals and variation on comparison expressions. We have shown that comparison is universally performed by gradable adjectives. Gradable adjectives like "tall" and "short" differ with regard to their direction. Languages with vs. without morphemes like "-er/more" differ with regard to whether gradable adjectives encode, by default, the meaning of non-strict vs. strict inequality. Based on this understanding of comparison, we have discussed the semantic contribution of cross-linguistic particles used in comparatives, focusing on English "-er/more" and Chinese "gèng". We analyze them as two kinds of additive particles: (i) English "-er/more" is similar to "another", while (ii) Chinese "gèng" is similar to "moreover". Thus the current work also connects the notion of scalarity (or comparison along a scale with ordering) with the notion of additivity.},

Instead, there are two independently attested features: numerability, the ability of a noun to combine with a numeral directly, distinguishes count from non-count nouns, and dimensionality, the ability of a noun to be modified by a size or shape modifier, distinguishes mass from non-mass nouns. Assuming numerals and size and shape modifiers are universally available, we are able to identify count and mass nominals in any language. Although all nouns in Chinese are non-count nouns, there is still a mass/non-mass contrast, with mass nouns selected by individuating classifiers and non-mass nouns selected by individual classifiers.},

I argue that this implicative reading is not due to the lexical semantics proper of enough/too, but due to its bi-clausal structure (e.g., the above-mentioned example is analyzed as Mary left early yesterday because she was clever enough). I analyze enough and too simply as degree modifiers that involve a comparison: enough means reaching the lower bound of an interval, while too means exceeding the upper bound of an interval. Then inspired by Schulz (2011), Baglini and Francez (2015), and Nadathur (2016), I relate the semantics of E/T constructions to causal dependence: due to some sufficiency/excess, the infinitival complement clause in E/T constructions is episodically or generically (depending on its aspect being perfective or imperfective) true/false. I also argue that this infinitive has its tense and aspect marked on the main predicate of sentences, resulting in the seeming correlation between aspect and implication in languages that overtly make a distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects (e.g., French).},

For example,~ Even Mary came cannot be used to answer a question like who came or who was unlikely to come. Instead, the felicitous use of~Even Mary came is to address issues like how successful the exhibition was, how enthusiastic people were, how urgent the matter was, etc. Thus I propose that the use of even is QUD-sensitive, always with regard to a contextually salient degree question. Even brings a degree-based presupposition of additivity, not an entity-based one (see also Greenberg 2018 for a similar view).~ An even-sentence~presupposes that its prejacent is associated with a degree value, a benchmark value higher than the usual contextual threshold, resolving a degree question with an increasingly positive answer. E.g., under a relevant scenario about how popular a certain talk was,~Even Mary came~is roughly interpreted as (the talk was so popular) that Mary came. Under the current analysis,~ the entity-based additivity and likelihood-based scalarity of even, which are considered presuppositions under the traditional view, are now considered implicatures.},

  abstract = {This paper argues for a unified account of mei ’every’ and thinks that Lin’s(1998) account that mei is a sum operator is more reasonable than any other analysis of mei. Specifically, mei operates on its associate-element and produces a maximal and plural set interpretation. Due to its emphasis on the unit of summation, mei has to co-occur with a distributive predicate. As a result, a mei-NP at the subject position requires its co-occurring predicate to be compatible with this distributive property.To be more specific, a mei-NP is incompatible with a collective predicate, though it can co-occur with a reciprocal predicate. Whether a mei-NP is compatible with a predicate with an adverbial universal quantifier or not depends on the property of the quantifier under consideration. It is required that the quantifier concerned not possess the property of emphasizing ’the whole’. Due to its property of emphasizing the whole, the adverb of universal quantifier quan/quanbu is, in general, incompatible with a mei-NP. Hence quan/quanbu cannot take a mei-NP as its quantificational domain. The adverb of universal quantification dou and distributive operators like ge make it possible for a predicate to meet the above requirement, thus licensing the subject mei-NP. This is because the adverb dou does not emphasize the whole and it merely requires its associate-element to be semantically plural, and the presence of distributive operators like ge makes the predicate in question distributive, which matches the semantics of mei.Since the sum operator mei is a unary operator and it only operates on its associated common noun phrase, it cannot establish an explicit semantic relation between its associate-element and the rest of the sentence. Furthermore, a preverbal mei-NP requires the semantic property of the predicate be compatible with it. Therefore, a subject mei-NP needs to be licensed. Universal quantifiers such as dou and(covert) distributive operators like ge can play the licensing role. A covert distributive operator can be assumed if the following conditions are met: a) a semantically plural NP with the distributive property occurs to the left of the predicate, which serves as the sorting key; and b) the distributive share is active, which is an indefinite NP or reflexive in the predicate.It is noted that a mei-sentence with one numeral expression always expresses the distributive meaning, while the interpretation of a sentence with two numeral noun phrases is influenced by contexts, for example, the tense operator. These two types of sentences are different even in the case of an implicit distributive operator: the former emphasizes the distributive meaning, whereas the latter highlights the corresponding relationship between the two numeral expressions, not always with the distributive interpretation.A mei-NP at the object position, functioning as the internal argument of the verb in question, does not impose the above compatibility requirement on the predicate co-occurring with it, though mei generally requires the occurrence of the object for the sum operation. In order to get the universal reading, a mei-NP should occur in the domain of the adverbial universal quantifier or the distributive operator.Since the universal reading does not come from mei but from its licensors such as dou and ge, mei receives a unified account, being a sum operator. It is claimed that Mandarin Chinese may be short of determiners of universal quantification, given that even the most likely candidate mei is a sum operator.},

  abstract = {The quantifier “some” often elicits a scalar implicature during comprehension: “Some of today's letters have checks inside” is often interpreted to mean that not all of today's letters have checks inside. In previous work, Goodman and Stuhlmüller (G\&S) proposed a model that predicts that this implicature should depend on the speaker's knowledgeability: If the speaker has only examined some of the available letters (e.g., two of three letters), people are less likely to infer that “some” implies “not all” than if the speaker has examined all of the available letters. G\&S also provided behavioral evidence in support of their model. In this paper, we first show that a simple extension of G\&S's model (1) predicts G\&S's knowledgeability effects, and in addition, (2) predicts that the knowledgeability effect will be reduced when the speaker's usage indicates numeral alternatives are available. We tested the new model's predictions in four preregistered experiments. All experiments supported the first model prediction, replicating G\&S's finding of a main effect of the speaker's knowledge. Further, Experiments 2 and 4 supported the second model prediction showing that the words that a speaker tends to use affect the strength of scalar implicature that comprehenders make. In particular, when the speaker has partial knowledge (e.g., has only examined two of three letters), comprehenders think that “some” is more likely to mean “not all” when the speaker also tends to produce number words in similar sentences (e.g., “2 of today's rooms have working smoke detectors.”). These results have important ramifications for theories of meaning: the context beyond the sentence (e.g., the speaker's tendency to use particular words) affects the set of alternatives that comprehenders consider when inferring meaning.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new perspective on the semantics of wh-questions and their answerhood. There are two layers involved in answering a wh-question: (i) its maximally informative analytical answer (which is analytical and world-independent) plus (ii) additional information (which can be various kinds of world-dependent information). This proposal is in the same spirit as Karttunen (1977)’s view that a question denotes its true answers and Dayal 1996’s view that a wh-question presupposes the existence of a maximally informative true answer. I show that a good wh-question always has a maximally informative analytical answer, which is true and complete and can be considered equal to the question meaning and constitutes the first layer of the answerhood. Built on this first layer, a typical, acceptable short answer contributes a second layer that provides additional information. Thus, a question like ’who smiled’ yields an analytically complete true answer: ‘the one(s) who smiled’. A short answer like ‘Melody and Khloe’ contributes further information about this definite item: ‘the one(s) who smiled’ is identical to (or includes) the sum Melody⊕Khloe. Inspired by the works of Brasoveanu (2013), Charlow (2014, 2017), Bumford (2017) on phenomena that demonstrate split (or multi-layered) semantics (e.g., cumulative-reading sentences, Haddock descriptions), I consider the ‘two-layered answerhood’ similar to post-suppositional phenomena and implement the proposed perspective within dynamic semantics. I show that the two layers involved in answering a wh-question correspond to (i) non-local, relativized definiteness and (ii) cardinality in a cumulative-reading sentence. I analyze various question-related phenomena with the proposed perspective and discuss theoretical implications, especially with regard to (i) L-analyticity (see Gajewski 2002/2016, Abrusa ́n 2014) as the driving force behind question interpretation and (ii) the distinction between an answer-based vs. an issue-based perspective on wh-clauses.},

Consequently, if the modal may is itself epistemic, (1) comes out as equivalent to (2), due to general laws of epistemic logic.

  abstract = {Bare plurals (dogs) behave in ways that quantified plurals (some dogs) do not. For instance, while the sentence John owns dogs implies that John owns more than one dog, its negation John does not own dogs does not mean “John does not own more than one dog”, but rather “John does not own a dog”. A second puzzling behavior is known as the dependent plural reading; when in the scope of another plural, the ‘more than one’ meaning of the plural is not distributed over, but the existential force of the plural is. For example, My friends attend good schools requires that each of my friends attend one good school, not more, while at the same time being inappropriate if all my friends attend the same school. This paper shows that both these phenomena, and others, arise from the same cause. Namely, the plural noun itself does not assert ‘more than one’, but rather the plural denotes a predicate that is number neutral (unspecified for cardinality). The ‘more than one’ meaning arises as an scalar implicature, relying on the scalar relationship between the bare plural and its singular alternative, and calculated in a sub-sentential domain; namely, before existential closure of the event variable. Finally, implications of this analysis will be discussed for the analysis of the quantified noun phrases that interact with bare plurals, such as indefinite numeral DPs (three boys), and singular universals (every boy).},
